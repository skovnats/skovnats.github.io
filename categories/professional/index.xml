      <description>[WIP] | [In Progress] { ‚ÄúIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.‚Äù
(Gospel of John 1:1)
It&#39;s time to sum up the words. That&#39;s what we&#39;ll talk about. } Since I use the word God, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t believe, so that we understand each other, I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce a working definition:
Definition:
God ‚Äî is a phenomenon that arises when a community unites for co-creation, and each becomes who they can truly be.</description>

      <description>Part 1 About the soul. A person is usually made up of sub-personalities that inhabit a metaphorical little town. In my town there is a Professor. The townspeople themselves gave him that title‚Äîan unimpeachable authority, always calm and impartial. A single gesture from him was enough to stop any conflict. He knew what to do&amp;hellip; in war and in famine. He appeared quietly when needed and disappeared just as quietly when the war and hunger ended&amp;hellip; in June 2019.</description>

      <description>Truth, once expressed in form (written, spoken, etc.), ceases to be truth ‚Äî including what I write... the usual exceptions are metaphors, parables, fairy tales, proverbs... music. After reading this training article, the reader will:
do some mental gymnastics which may, perhaps, increase awareness and thereby bring more freedom to one‚Äôs thinking and, as a result, to one‚Äôs life; it‚Äôs worth periodically rereading this training article, taking notes, trying to grasp the meanings laid out and the links between them.</description>

      <description>Œ©. Taking stock of a life stage. I searched for answers to ‚Äúwhy all this?‚Äù and ‚Äúhow to find inner joy and peace?‚Äù. I tried every external source available‚Äîfrom society, spiritual practices, and science to cultures, religions, books, and films. None fit. I found my own path. It isn‚Äôt new, but I hope the way I present it will be clear. If not‚Äîask me (contacts below).
To clarify ‚Äúmy coordinates‚Äù and the path to my current state, I‚Äôll briefly lay out my story.</description>
