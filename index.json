I developed a recommendation algorithm that, based on the limited data left by the customer, allowed us to make an initial assessment of the likelihood of the person becoming a customer. This allowed more efficient use of the limited resources of the sales department, focusing on those most likely to benefit from interaction with the company. You are considering a pivot and are looking for promising options and strategies you may have overlooked\nDetails The startup suddenly lost its main client, ImmoScout24 GmbH, which on the same day launched a similar product on its website, immobilienmakler. As the largest player in the real estate market in Germany and a de facto monopoly, it became clear that the company was doomed unless it quickly changed its business model: the cost of acquiring customers had skyrocketed, the main client left, and that client became the main competitor on its own platform. The company founders asked all employees for ideas on how to save the business and ensure its survival at this critical moment. We entered the “make it or break it” phase.\nI proposed my vision and gave two presentations, one to the entire company. Ultimately, one of my ideas, after some refinement, was chosen as the main strategy. My understanding of both data and business processes played a key role in this situation.\nYou have incomplete or faulty data and need methods to extract valuable insights\nDetails The data was poor: for example, the construction date in some cases was later than the date the object was first entered into the database, with a discrepancy of years. This was just one of many problems. Using another database, I was able to build a model that improved the main database, and then, using methods I developed, trained a final model. It delivered sufficiently good results, allowing us to attract a new client (Skoda GmbH) and open new horizons for the company, including the creation of a new division. The final refinement of the results was later handled by another data scientist, as the task became more “classical” at that point.\nYou are in crisis and need an objective, detached perspective from someone who finds hidden opportunities in complex situations\nYou are facing personal challenges and want to talk to someone who has gone through hardships and can offer potential solutions\nDespite your efforts, the results aren’t satisfying — this may signal a “blind spot” that I can help identify and eliminate\nYou need feedback on your grant or strategic proposal with a focus on key points\nDetails A consulting company with extensive experience in securing such grants prepared the application. I designed and proposed a solution for the technical part of the application, based on cutting-edge approaches (SOTA) and offering innovative solutions. The text of the application was handled by the consulting company. I was invited to present the technical part of the application to the commission. I proposed my vision of which aspects to emphasize and how to present the material. The commission approved the application for 1.2 million euros on the condition that changes be made to reflect the focus points I had proposed.\nYou are dealing with a unique case not covered by “best practices” or common sources like Google or ChatGPT\nDetails At a data conference with many attendees, one guest, instead of asking a question, started promoting their startup. We later crossed paths, and I suggested discussing the situation privately. When he approached me, I pointed out his strategic mistake. In 99% of cases, assertiveness and rule-breaking might work for startups, but not in his case. His company works with super-personal data like medical and financial records, where trust is key. By breaking the rules for profit, he sent the wrong signal. In his business, ethics should come first, not profit. I wasn’t trying to give him a tool for manipulation but rather “held up a mirror” for him to reflect on. Details Encoding a list of strings into a numerical representation for machine learning model training, reflecting important business interactions, turned out to be an unsolved problem in public sources. Typically, final categories are encoded, but in my case, I needed to encode a long list of categories (e.g., “equipment” including brake systems, seat quality, and radios). Binary encoding could create 250+ columns with sparse ones and many zeros. I developed an advanced method that encoded the categories into a single column of numbers, representing the values of the respective categories. Companies working with big data and developing data-driven products\nMentor - Coach Facilitator — “Translator” Details I needed to leave, but I needed permission from someone who wasn’t willing to give it. Around me was a group of people who didn’t fully understand each other, but only I realized this. Using my ability to understand people and see the limits of their understanding, I managed to structure communication so that the vital permission was obtained. My entire future depended on that permission. I understand people well and often notice things that others miss, stuck in their perceptions of the world and others. This situation can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. Clarity, understanding the other person, and open dialogue — with both parties willing to negotiate — form the basis of mutually beneficial and long-lasting cooperation.\nIf you need to resolve a conflict, understand someone, or find the right words to be heard, maybe I can help, drawing on my life experience. I don’t use specific methods — my approach is based solely on the task at hand, the context, and the people involved. Everyone has a unique story, their own “personal dictionary” or “language,” where the same words can carry entirely different meanings, emotions, and values. For one, “love” might mean calling or texting every hour, while for another, it’s not bothering them during work. And that’s just one example of how words in a “personal dictionary” can have different meanings depending on context, time of year, mood, and other factors.\nMaybe I can be the “translator” between different “personal dictionaries” to help find a “new point” or “angle” on the situation, from which new opportunities and mutually beneficial solutions become visible.\nA port for \"sinking and lost ships\" Details Once there was a boy who grew up in unusual circumstances. He was appreciated when he behaved “properly,” and so he learned to value himself only for his accomplishments. Inside him was an “emptiness” that, as he later found, was only temporarily filled when he did something. At the time, it seemed “cool” to be in the spotlight, to do extraordinary and difficult things, to stand out — and that’s exactly what he did. But the emptiness didn’t go away, and the pain inside didn’t subside. Even sex helped dull the pain temporarily. That’s how he lived as long as he had the strength to “do,” so as not to accidentally stop and look “inside,” to simply “be.” All this time, he placed his “inner burden” on those around him, which led to the loss of a loved one.\nAfter this, the boy decided that at any cost, he would “clear out” his inner “Augean stables” and build a new life. On this path, he had to “drink and remove” the lake of “acid” and the “well” of “filth,” and even “look death in the face.” Sometimes, to “start living,” you need to look death in the face.\nNow this man wants other “children” to be “heard.” He wants to ease their pain and suffering, showing them, with love, possible alternatives and reminding them that everything they need is already inside them, waiting for them. Or direct them to the people and “forces” that helped him, to the “light” that “illuminates the path to oneself and beyond.”\nOne day, a “girl” came to him, with a “storm” raging inside her, and she needed a “shelter.” “Externally,” this looked like erratic behavior, and she was even sent to a “home for such people.” The man did not judge her but tried to help within his ability and her capacity to “see at that moment” what he was showing. He pointed out the “currents” and “whirlpools” that, perhaps, she shouldn’t “sail into,” and where there were “islands” she could “row” toward.\nThe man knew there were “forces” that didn’t want “ships” to leave certain “currents” and “whirlpools.” While they were there, these forces could “transport what they needed on those ships,” even if it “sank the boats.” The man challenged these forces, and the “girl’s boat,” in her “storm,” found “understanding, sustenance, and refuge” for further independent sailing. The next day, the man’s “port” was robbed, but that’s how it goes. The main thing is that the “girl’s boat” is now sailing independently, deciding for itself what to “carry” and where to “sail.”\n\"Facing the Mirror\" Painted in 04.2020\nLife experiences shape our view of the world, which in turn channels our thoughts and determines our choices.

I follow this principle in both big life decisions and everyday matters, from major life choices to something as simple as using a restroom at a conference.\nОставляй всё, как минимум, не хуже, чем было до тебя. Я придерживаюсь этого принципа как в глобальных вопросах, так и в повседневных делах: от важных жизненных решений до посещения туалетной кабинки на конференции.\nMeaningful engagement | Значимая вовлечённость I avoid participating in projects and activities that don\u0026rsquo;t address significant problems or that distract from meaningful, systemic changes. For example, in most cases, LGBTQIA+/transgender rights advocacy, “revolutions” in payment systems that don’t change the real distribution of wealth but merely make transactions smoother, and startup “revolutions” that ultimately increase social and financial tension in society are not issues that interest me.\nI am drawn to initiatives that lead to real and long-term change. This includes efforts to combat pedophilia, slavery, conflicts fueled by the military-industrial complex, and resistance to dehumanizing political agendas. I also value projects that transform lives, return natural resources to their rightful countries, strengthen education systems by teaching people to “fish” rather than simply giving them handouts, and create companies that benefit all levels of society — from the poorest to the wealthiest.\nIt is also important to me that I leave the world and the state of affairs for our children no worse than I inherited from my parents.\nЯ избегаю участия в проектах и активностях, которые не решают существенных проблем или отвлекают внимание от значимых и системных изменений. Например, в большинстве случаев защита прав LGBTQIA+/трансгендерных людей, “революции” в платёжных системах без изменения реального распределения выгод, которые лишь упрощают оплату продуктов, а также “революции” стартапов, которые в конечном итоге усиливают социальную и финансовую напряжённость в обществе, — это не те вопросы, которые меня интересуют.\nМеня привлекают инициативы, ведущие к реальным и долгосрочным изменениям. Например, борьба с педофилией, рабством, разжиганием конфликтов оружейными комплексами и противодействие человеконенавистническим программам. Важными для меня также являются проекты, которые меняют жизни людей, возвращают странам их природные ресурсы, усиливают образовательные системы, обучая людей “ловить рыбу”, а не просто выдавать её, создают компании, приносящие выгоду всем слоям общества — от самых бедных до самых богатых.\nТакже для меня важно оставить нашим детям мир и состояние дел в не худшем состоянии, чем я унаследовал от моих родителей.\nValues | Ценности Compassion and humanity I strive to understand people, view the world from their perspective, and consider their inner qualities and behavior. Honesty and the pursuit of truth I strive to be honest with myself and those around me, while seeking the truth. Kindness I strive to forgive both myself and others. Bravery and courage I strive to think independently and act according to my conscience. People, connection with the living The living is invaluable; the rest is secondary. Win-win solutions My goal is to identify and implement points of sustainable balance in systems, while avoiding imbalance. Win-win solutions demonstrate greater long-term stability compared to other approaches. Simplicity and minimalism My life has space for: what is \"God-pleasing\" and alive useful beautiful joyful everything else is superfluous. Adaptation I adjust to my environment and those around me as long as it doesn’t contradict my principles; otherwise, I withdraw. When the opportunity allows, I find and propose alternative options. I prefer when things work in real life I prioritize solutions that work in real life, although I do enjoy elegant theories as well. Freedom I highly value freedom in thought and forms of expression. Сострадание и человечность Я стараюсь понять людей, увидеть мир их глазами и обращать внимание на их внутренние качества и поступки. Честность и стремление к истине Стремлюсь к честности с собой и окружающими, находясь в поиске истины. Доброта Стремлюсь прощать как себя, так и других. Храбрость и мужество Стремлюсь мыслить самостоятельно и поступать по совести. Люди, связь с живым Живое бесценно, остальное — вторично. Взаимовыгодные подходы Моя цель — находить и реализовывать «точки устойчивого баланса в системах», избегая дисбалансов. Взаимовыгодные решения обеспечивают более долгосрочную устойчивость по сравнению с альтернативами. Простота и минимализм В моей жизни есть место: «Богу угодному» и живому полезному красивому радостному всё остальное лишнее. Адаптация Я адаптируюсь к среде и людям, если это не противоречит моим ценностям; в противном случае стараюсь устраниться. При наличии возможности, нахожу и предлагаю альтернативные решения. Я предпочитаю, когда вещи работают в жизни Мне важно, чтобы решения работали и применялись на практике, хотя я также ценю красивую теорию. Свобода Я высоко ценю свободу в мышлении и способах выражения. A = Ω The word \"devil\" comes from the Greek word διάβολος (diábolos), which can be translated as \"to divide,\" \"to separate\", or more literally, \"to throw against.\" I strive to live mindfully. I \"build and strengthen bridges\", avoiding and not supporting their \"destruction or weakening\". Everything important has already been said before me. In my reflections and endeavors, there will be ideas that might resonate with some. If so, feel free to join: meeting, email, Telegram, LinkedIn.\nСлово «дьявол» происходит от греческого слова διάβολος (диáболос), которое можно перевести как «разделять», «разъединять» или более буквально — «бросать против». Стараюсь жить осознанно. Я «строю и укрепляю мосты», избегая и не поддерживая их «разрушение или ослабление». Всё важное уже было сказано до меня.

Master Splinter and the turtles lived \u0026ldquo;invisibly\u0026rdquo; from humans for many years, underground, occasionally helping them fight crime. Also, my name plays with letters and words: Art(iom) → Art \u0026hellip; the rAt.\nOmega and A are references to God (Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;I am the Alpha and Omega\u0026rdquo;) and also to my birthday: the last day of all zodiac signs and the last day of the calendar year according to the solar calendar, the day before \u0026ldquo;Nowruz\u0026rdquo; — the \u0026ldquo;new day.\u0026rdquo; Omega symbolizes completion and finality; in numerology, my birth date corresponds to the number 9, which is also the last number in the decimal system.\nA also refers to the first letter of my name and symbolizes a \u0026ldquo;new day\u0026rdquo; or beginning — since every ending (Omega) is the start of something new (A). π (pi) is the first letter of the Greek word πνεῦμα (pneuma), meaning \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;soul.\u0026rdquo; π comes before A because the soul precedes form or matter.\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to ask!\nЯ родился в год Крысы, и мне близок образ мудрой старой крысы Мастера Сплинтера из \u0026ldquo;Черепашек-ниндзя\u0026rdquo;, который с заботой и любовью воспитал воинов-черепах, сражавшихся за справедливость. Мастер Сплинтер и его черепашки жили долгие годы \u0026ldquo;невидимо\u0026rdquo; для людей, как бы в стороне, под землёй, иногда помогая им в борьбе с преступностью. Кроме того, на английском моё имя играет с буквами и словами: Art(iom) → Art \u0026hellip; the rAt.\nОмега и А — это отсылки к Богу (Иисус говорил: \u0026ldquo;Я — Альфа и Омега\u0026rdquo;), а также к моей дате рождения: последний день всех знаков зодиака и последний день календарного года по солнечному календарю, день перед \u0026ldquo;Навруз\u0026rdquo; — \u0026ldquo;новым днём\u0026rdquo;. Омега символизирует завершение и подведение итогов; в нумерологии моя дата рождения соответствует числу 9 — последнему в десятеричной системе.\nА также отсылает к первой букве моего имени, символизируя \u0026ldquo;новый день\u0026rdquo; или начало, ведь любое завершение — это одновременно и начало чего-то нового. π (пи) — это первая буква греческого слова πνεῦμα (пневма), одно из значений которого — душа. π стоит перед А, потому что душа первична и важнее формы — материи.\nЕсли есть ещё вопросы, с радостью проясню.\nMy perspective on academia | Моё мнение об академической среде Please note that everything expressed is based on my personal experience and may not reflect the overall situation\u0026hellip; I hope that\u0026rsquo;s the case. The academic environment is increasingly influenced by capitalism: the pursuit of truth and solving complex problems has been replaced by a focus on productivity and success metrics. Importance is placed on citation counts, publications in prestigious journals, collaborations with well-known scientists, and impressive résumé entries.\nThe system encourages focusing on easy tasks (\u0026ldquo;low-hanging fruits\u0026rdquo;), unjustified complication of texts with excessive formulas and terms to enhance perceived contributions, as well as non-reproducible research, data manipulation, granting funds to \u0026ldquo;insiders,\u0026rdquo; and low-quality peer reviews due to overburdened professors.\nHonest research struggles to compete with those employing dishonest methods. This is a systemic issue, but sometimes the fault of individuals.\nPersonal Experience:\nIn one of my studies, we cited a work whose method we didn\u0026rsquo;t use to create an impression of automation and increase citation counts. Attempts to correct this misconception were unsuccessful. After publication, many requested the code, but results couldn\u0026rsquo;t be reproduced. I had to explain why it didn\u0026rsquo;t work, spending time on justifications and internal turmoil.\nIn another article for a prestigious conference, mathematical errors and data falsifications occurred. The paper was written hastily without thorough proofreading. Before the deadline, I was asked to \u0026ldquo;adjust\u0026rdquo; the results; I tried to minimize manipulations, but errors remained. The idea of the paper was weak and unclear to me, except for enhancing the résumé. Later, I was reproached, and I felt ashamed, even though the text wasn\u0026rsquo;t mine.\nThis experience shook my trust in academic \u0026ldquo;titles\u0026rdquo; and the system. The level of graduates only confirmed my doubts about the value of the formal academic system.\nThe Problem is Systemic:\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a devaluation of academic publications and titles. We produce a vast amount of materials that may only distract intelligent people from truly important tasks.\nI believe that people with outstanding abilities should use them for the benefit of society, helping the less gifted and \u0026ldquo;lighting the way\u0026rdquo; for others, not abusing their talents. It\u0026rsquo;s like a strong boxer using his superiority against beginners.\nNevertheless, I believe most scientists still strive for truth and honest research. Otherwise, the situation would be much worse.\nОбратите внимание, что всё сказанное основано на моём личном опыте и может не отражать общую картину\u0026hellip; надеюсь, что так. Академическая среда всё больше подвержена влиянию капитализма: стремление к поиску истины и решению сложных задач заменилось ориентацией на показатели продуктивности и успеха. Важными считаются количество цитирований, публикации в престижных журналах, сотрудничество с известными учёными и впечатляющие строки в резюме.\nСистема стимулирует фокус на лёгкие задачи (\u0026ldquo;low hanging fruits\u0026rdquo;), неоправданное усложнение текстов через избыточные формулы и термины для повышения видимости вклада, а также невоспроизводимые исследования, манипуляции с данными, выдачу грантов \u0026ldquo;своим людям\u0026rdquo; и низкое качество рецензирования из-за перегруженности профессоров.\nЧестные исследования трудно конкурируют с теми, кто использует нечестные методы. Это системная проблема, но иногда вина отдельных людей.\nЛичный опыт:\nВ одном из моих исследований мы цитировали работу, метод которой не использовали, чтобы создать впечатление автоматизации и увеличить количество цитирований. Попытки исправить это заблуждение не увенчались успехом. После публикации многие просили код, но результаты не воспроизводились. Мне пришлось объяснять, почему это не работает, тратя время на оправдания и внутренние переживания.\nВ другой статье для престижной конференции были допущены математические ошибки и фальсификации данных. Статья писалась в спешке без возможности тщательной проверки. Перед дедлайном мне предложили \u0026ldquo;подкорректировать\u0026rdquo; результаты; я старался минимизировать подтасовки, но ошибки остались. Идея статьи была слабой и непонятной мне, кроме как для усиления резюме. Позже меня упрекнули, и я чувствовал стыд, хотя текст был не моим.\nЭтот опыт поколебал моё доверие к академическим \u0026ldquo;титулам\u0026rdquo; и системе. Уровень выпускников только подтвердил мои сомнения в ценности формальной академической системы.\nПроблема системна:\nПроисходит девальвация академических публикаций и титулов. Мы создаём огромное количество материалов, которые, возможно, лишь отвлекают умных людей от действительно важных задач.\nЯ считаю, что люди с выдающимися способностями \u0026ldquo;имеют долг\u0026rdquo; использовать их на благо общества, помогая менее одарённым и \u0026ldquo;освещая путь\u0026rdquo; другим, а не злоупотреблять своими талантами. Это как если бы сильный боксёр использовал своё превосходство против новичков.\nТем не менее, я верю, что большинство учёных стремятся к истине и честным исследованиям. Иначе ситуация была бы намного хуже.\n","date":"September 17, 2024","hero":"/posts/philosophy/hero.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/philosophy/","summary":"Leave everything, at the very least, no worse than it was before you.

After reading this, the reader will have an understanding of:\nwho they are dealing with where I came from what my values are where I am going if we are on the same path and for how long, if yes Ω. There are meanings that are worth expressing. I tried all the available answers in the literal and figurative sense of the word, which were offered to me from the outside (for example, by society, spiritual practices, science, cultures, religions, books, films, etc.), but none of the answers suited me\u0026hellip; and I found it my way. The answer is not new. I hope the forms I’ve chosen will be understood. If not — feel free to ask, the contact details are below. When I talk about the answer, I mean the answer to the question \u0026ldquo;What is all this for?\u0026rdquo;\nIn my coordinate system, Socrates was a spiritual practitioner. I also consider myself a spiritual practitioner\u0026hellip; and still ignorant in some matters, and a fool. Anyone can be my teacher\u0026hellip; I practice my method\u0026hellip; similar to the \u0026ldquo;Socratic method.\u0026rdquo; I invent different practices for myself and those who come to me; tailored to the individual, the task, and the context.\nIn my articles, I will propose and explain how my approach to modeling reality works, and a new form of interaction; if there are questions — I will answer them. There will be 7 articles and/or lectures in total, not counting this introductory one. I have often received feedback that I am not much of a writer, to say the least, but I’m a good lecturer, so I will make video presentations for each article. Also, metaphorical stories will be woven into all the articles — it is easier for me to convey ideas and meanings this way.\nIn the paradigm I propose, many social and technological contradictions and conflicts are resolved. For example, the conflict between different social classes: investor, owner, worker, director, manager, employee, and client; weak AI in this paradigm becomes an assistant, not a threat or a replacement for humans; people gradually increase their level of awareness, and much more that is not obvious. Whether to apply this and in what form, everyone decides for themselves. I do not call for anything, but I offer.\nImportant:\neverything I write is not the ultimate truth, but an invitation to discussion.\nI think that the articles may be of interest to \u0026ldquo;architects\u0026rdquo; who invent \u0026ldquo;games\u0026rdquo; for themselves and others. Perhaps, it will be useful to think of me as an \u0026ldquo;architect for architects.\u0026rdquo;\nA bit of symbolism at the end. Ω — Omega, is the last letter of the Greek alphabet\u0026hellip; the end, the summing up. I was born on the last day of all the zodiac signs, closing the horoscope year, and on the last day of the astronomical solar calendar year — March 20, 1984, which corresponds to the number 9 in numerology, the last number in the decimal system. In the year of the rat. I consider myself \u0026ldquo;both fish and meat\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;fish\u0026rdquo; transitioning into \u0026ldquo;Aries\u0026rdquo;). In the articles and video lectures, I also sum up and propose an image of the future, because any end is also the beginning of something new\u0026hellip; Perhaps you’ve noticed that the world is changing, that we may be on the brink of an era. At the same time, my name carries the symbol of a beginning — Α, the first letter of my name and the Greek alphabet; my name originates from the Greek goddess Αρτεμισία, the goddess not only of the hunt, but also of the protection of children and conception, the beginning of new life.\nA. aka MS.\n26.05.2024\nPart 1 About the Soul. A person typically consists of subpersonalities that inhabit their metaphorical town. In my town, there is a professor. This title was given to him by the townspeople themselves — he is an unquestionable authority, always calm and impartial. A single gesture from him was enough to stop any conflict. He knew what to do\u0026hellip; both in war and in famine. He appeared unnoticed when needed, and just as unnoticed, he disappeared when the war and famine ended\u0026hellip; in June 2019. The address on his note — Crete. Perhaps, after completing the survival task, he went to rest and search for a meaning that is worth expressing. He and part of the town survived only thanks to him. But surviving\u0026hellip; is that the most important thing\u0026hellip; or?\nMy answer: physical survival is meaningless if the soul is betrayed, it is the most valuable thing; the professor ensured the survival of the soul, even if it meant sacrificing many other residents of the conditional town and physical health.\nExplanation: \u0026ldquo;wars and famines\u0026rdquo; stay with us inside for a long time after experiencing real catastrophes, sometimes — forever.\nPart 2 About Survival. Our symbolic inner town is dual to external reality. There, too, are conflicts and even wars.\nWars can be different: hybrid, with obvious enemies or without. There are complex wars — when the enemy inside a person, due to ignorance, illness, or ill intent, brings internal war to others\u0026hellip; it may even come in a beautiful package, with beautiful and correct words\u0026hellip; you don’t immediately understand how you ended up with a war and famine\u0026hellip; and inside as well. Internal war, if left unaddressed, can start a war in external reality. The source of internal enemies\u0026hellip; a lack of love\u0026hellip; for oneself\u0026hellip;\nThere are conflicts whose price is survival. They can be with anyone, including internal enemies of one’s mother and other close ones. The hardest part is when such conflicts occur before you have formed, as a child, for example, and even harder if you depend on these \u0026ldquo;opponents\u0026rdquo; — it is especially difficult and you have to be without a mother\u0026hellip; and without authorities. Even harder if, in addition, there is no one around to lean on. Sometimes this is not due to someone’s internal enemies; sometimes people freeze from fear, unable to move\u0026hellip; and you have to be without a father. But everything can change in a second. You have to use whatever comes to hand, any opportunity, learn to achieve the desired result with minimal resources. Even harder when, on top of that, your mother fell ill, \u0026ldquo;went mad,\u0026rdquo; and controls everything\u0026hellip; and the external environment has collapsed, famine\u0026hellip;\nIn the survival war, it is important to minimize dependence on others — to plan strategies so that enemies cannot theoretically interfere with long-term tasks\u0026hellip; internal enemies of relatives, first of all, in the context of the above. Complex wars also occur when internal enemies of parents are on different sides, tearing you apart. In war, you have to be constantly vigilant, watching and noticing the slightest changes, habits, speech patterns, deviations from the \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo;-\u0026ldquo;template\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; be able to quickly assess the situation.\nThe model of my mother is probably the first model I built. Then my father’s. I learned to model people’s characters, identify certain properties, even by appearance. Because with models there is predictability. People are predictable if you’ve been with them in war and famine, and they’ve overcome their internal enemies (cowardice, arrogance, etc.). Sometimes it’s a pity when there’s no war and famine; it’s much easier to understand people\u0026hellip; otherwise it’s hard.\nExplanation: unresolved internal problems of a person usually affect them and others. Under difficult external circumstances, internal problems are exacerbated: if the \u0026ldquo;roof of the house\u0026rdquo; is poorly secured, but the weather is clear, it will hold up, and you won’t immediately know there’s a problem. They become apparent when there’s a \u0026ldquo;hurricane.\u0026rdquo; In my experience, a person reveals themselves in \u0026ldquo;times of hurricanes\u0026rdquo; or power, often unexpectedly for the person themselves. In normal times, a person uses masks, maybe very \u0026ldquo;thick\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;quality\u0026rdquo; ones. Since I lived in extreme survival conditions for many years, it is important for me to understand who I am with, whether I can rely on this person in any situation, including \u0026ldquo;war.\u0026rdquo; It is very difficult, maybe even impossible to say, if a person has not at least once been in an extreme situation\u0026hellip; that is why it is difficult to understand people, \u0026ldquo;when there’s no war and famine.\u0026rdquo;\nPart 3 About the Bunker. The purpose of the bunker is survival and preservation in an extremely unpredictable, contradictory, and hostile environment. Survival of the soul is the priority.\nThe existence of the bunker was a secret. It was probably built by a child, but it feels like it was under someone\u0026rsquo;s guidance. It was \u0026ldquo;underground\u0026rdquo; and absolutely invisible. It let almost nothing in from the outside without filtration and thorough preliminary analysis: neither \u0026ldquo;air,\u0026rdquo; nor \u0026ldquo;water,\u0026rdquo; nor \u0026ldquo;information,\u0026rdquo; nor \u0026ldquo;shouts,\u0026rdquo; nor laws/norms/orders/traditions/fashion\u0026hellip; nor words/values/emotions from the mother, father\u0026hellip; nor anyone or anything else. 1 lived there. Many other residents of the town\u0026hellip; many\u0026hellip; did not survive or were severely injured by frequent almost unpredictable emissions of poison, filth, and vinegar into the \u0026ldquo;soil,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;water,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;air\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; as well as from clashes in various types of wars. All these corpses were stored in the \u0026ldquo;manor house,\u0026rdquo; which was intended for 1\u0026hellip; this was the easiest way to dispose of the bodies. It was difficult for 1 to befriend anyone in the \u0026ldquo;town\u0026rdquo; or make contact since they were the main target\u0026hellip; people and animals close to them were immediately in danger\u0026hellip; as was the case with his beloved dog, which he even started bringing into the bunker\u0026hellip; it was killed\u0026hellip; after that, he didn’t make such mistakes — no more getting close. \u0026ldquo;Poison,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;toxins,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;filth\u0026rdquo; formed a large lake over the years. The \u0026ldquo;well,\u0026rdquo; which used to contain the \u0026ldquo;purest water,\u0026rdquo; over the years filled to the brim with filth, feces, urine, etc., due to runoff from the bunker and other external sources. In 2019, 1 purified all the filth, drank it and digested it, also removing all the stench and corpses. The peak came in July 2020 — the bunker was opened\u0026hellip; to clean everything inside and establish contact. The entire village, the lake, the well, and the house are ready for settlement and interaction.\nPart 4 About People. People are different — sometimes a person has so many internal enemies that it is a pity\u0026hellip; they are always with him and he sees their shadows in others.\nObservations.\nInterestingly, a shark taken out of the water is harmless and dies immediately. The environment is crucial.\nA tough and experienced mechanic named Kolya turned into a 3-to-5-year-old helpless child with a trembling body from fear — Sanya, the captain of our small fishing vessel, yelled at him. Afghanistan — captivity. Unresolved past traumas heavily influence future life.\nKolya — a homeless man in \u0026ldquo;Shokoladnitsa\u0026rdquo; in the center of Moscow told me about his childhood — I understood that he was not loved, there was no one to believe in and support him during his childhood, even though he was kind — he took leftover food to his homeless friends even though no one was nearby. People from our surroundings shape us, and it\u0026rsquo;s important that at the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; moment, someone supports us.\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s useful to crawl — I crawled out of a circle of 8 people and \u0026ldquo;Hey kid, got a light?\u0026rdquo; but Denis didn’t. I ran to the exit — freedom, but my friend was already on the ground, surrounded. \u0026ldquo;Russians don\u0026rsquo;t leave their own\u0026rdquo; — I had to stay\u0026hellip; Then there were two boxer friends. It turns out not everyone can look the crowd in the eyes and \u0026ldquo;stay.\u0026rdquo; But you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t blame\u0026hellip; forgiveness is important\u0026hellip; of yourself too if necessary.\nThe children in Palestine ran after our buses. From the window, it seemed they lived in the \u0026ldquo;5th century AD.\u0026rdquo; Maybe they even thought that way\u0026hellip; they looked happy.\nA laborer in Palestine — it’s sad, you’re in your underwear with a brigade in someone’s house for the night, and the former owners come to collect their belongings\u0026hellip; their previous life is behind them. This was familiar to me, I too had left my past behind\u0026hellip; but often it stays inside, only later does it manifest outside.\nA pickpocket-thief, who had served time, \u0026ldquo;touring\u0026rdquo; Moscow, passed \u0026ldquo;interviews\u0026rdquo; with a gang, with whom we became friends, remains in memory — interesting, would he have become a thief if the USSR hadn\u0026rsquo;t collapsed, but he was talented, gifted by God to speak with people.\nMany criticize the past, the USSR, but everything good that happened in my life came from the USSR. I watched from the bunker as the \u0026ldquo;hurricanes,\u0026rdquo; starting with the collapse of the country and the formation of a new one, carried away an uncountable number of \u0026ldquo;roofs of houses\u0026rdquo;: drug addicts, maniacs, perverts, violence, the chase after shiny trinkets, racketeering, thefts, privatization, impoverishment, and much, much more. A guy I crossed paths with in boxing, and during one conflict, killed an old woman for 50 kopecks by jumping on her with friends. Yet, in boxing, he was quieter than water and lower than grass, but in my school, he was the \u0026ldquo;main bandit\u0026rdquo; — people manifest differently in different contexts.\nInterestingly, academic articles contain lies, and it is done deliberately, particularly to \u0026ldquo;survive\u0026rdquo; in the race for citations and publications.\nAn old professor in the \u0026ldquo;father\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; office asked, \u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t you ashamed of this article? Where was \u0026lsquo;father\u0026rsquo; looking?\u0026rdquo;; I was confused and ashamed, and the article was written in a week\u0026hellip; I barely had time to get the results\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;father\u0026rdquo; wrote the entire text, pressured me, told me what to do\u0026hellip; and at the end, 10 minutes before the article submission deadline, he directly said \u0026ldquo;falsify the results\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; I did everything I could to avoid shame\u0026hellip; I even outright refused to include it in my doctorate\u0026hellip; although \u0026ldquo;father\u0026rdquo; pressured me. Now I have no trust in all these big journals, universities, and professors.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t blame \u0026ldquo;father,\u0026rdquo; he plays by the system’s rules\u0026hellip; there are much worse cases. Like my friend Dima\u0026rsquo;s: they conduct research on cancer patients, and there \u0026ldquo;inaccuracies\u0026rdquo; play a \u0026ldquo;slightly\u0026rdquo; different role and consequences.\nIt seems they enjoy this game of numbers and prestige. In business, it\u0026rsquo;s more honest — there’s at least a \u0026ldquo;need\u0026rdquo; criterion, though not always. But power/money/prestige\u0026hellip; is that the most important thing\u0026hellip; or?\nMy answer: I love science and for me, above all: truth - freedom - love. Power is a strong drug, and money is just a tool. My grandfather used to say that of all the inventions of humanity, money is closest to the Devil. I agree, though I’m not sure it\u0026rsquo;s the closest. In general, money is a big test. Also, it seems to me that we, people who were given a \u0026ldquo;clear head\u0026rdquo; and the trust/money from society to conduct research, have a moral responsibility to make everyone’s life better.\nExplanation: from the bunker, it is clearly visible how the environment shapes a person — how we learn, what value means, what is good and bad\u0026hellip; how we should act\u0026hellip; think\u0026hellip; feel\u0026hellip; and then we don’t even realize why we feel a certain way in a particular situation. For \u0026ldquo;99.99999%\u0026rdquo; of people, it’s enough to create the environment-conditions\u0026hellip; they will absorb everything themselves and will do what is \u0026ldquo;needed.\u0026rdquo; This is clearly illustrated in the \u0026ldquo;Matrix\u0026rdquo; trilogy in the context of a science fiction scenario, which, in my observations, \u0026ldquo;well\u0026rdquo; describes the real state of affairs. Naturally, by \u0026ldquo;father\u0026rdquo; I mean my academic mentor.\nPart 5 About the Core. Faith comes in many forms — my great-grandmother was devout, often crossing herself, reading the \u0026ldquo;Our Father\u0026rdquo; prayer and other prayers. She told me as much as she could about faith and about Jesus. She was strict, but predictable.\nIt’s a pity I didn’t live with her all the time; I felt good with her, better than with my mom and dad: when war and famine occurred, their internal enemies took over, and it was extremely tough.\nShe instilled something very deep\u0026hellip; and the image of Jesus. This deepness became the foundation upon which the bunker was built. The image of Jesus remained somewhere very high\u0026hellip; a star in the sky, a guiding star. But since I was stubborn and didn’t believe in anything or anyone, I denied the existence of God\u0026hellip; until the moment the bunker was opened.\nLater, I learned about other stars. It seems we rarely look up at our guiding stars anymore, and more and more to the sides\u0026hellip; at the neighbor, at phones, social networks, news, trinkets, money, etc.\nBut I know that \u0026ldquo;this\u0026rdquo; during \u0026ldquo;war and famine\u0026rdquo; is unimportant. A relative or just a decent person, clean air, water, food, peace, and nature\u0026hellip; those things are important. Sometimes it’s a pity when there’s no war and famine; it’s much easier to understand values\u0026hellip; otherwise, it’s hard.\nExplanation: human psychology is usually structured like an onion, with a certain core inside. The masks/peels fall off under pressure, as I wrote in Part 2. Having been without water, food, peace, shelter, silence, sleep, or a close person, you understand what is truly valuable.\nPart 6 About Values. Gratitude comes in many forms — sometimes you stand up for someone against the crowd, but then they switch sides, and now you’re in their place. His weakness and cowardice\u0026hellip; it happens\u0026hellip; the main thing is for it to pass.\nIn situations where I couldn\u0026rsquo;t cope psychologically, I used \u0026ldquo;forgetting.\u0026rdquo; I forgot so many things. True, I used to suffer from terrible headaches. But you choose the lesser of two evils\u0026hellip; I guess.\nI stopped exposing myself to harm by helping — I learned; now I help when I can\u0026hellip; although I almost always overestimate my strength, but I’ve devised a system — I help at 80% of what I think I can do or offer. After that, if I can do more — I multiply by 80% again and so on. It works.\nWhen I was 14, I was paid 14 hryvnias for an entire night unloading grain from a truck with a trailer, possibly 20-25 tons (I was with a group). Ice cream was the only thing I kept for myself; the rest I gave to my parents\u0026hellip; hunger.\nI was the best speaker, a builder, a shark catcher, I helped the Estonian government with cadastral land data analysis, worked with children — even received an award, worked on plantations for Koreans for onions, DJing at discos, assistant boxing coach in Israel at university, and much more.\nI stopped working with Estonia when I realized that as a result, my model would lead to a significant increase in payments to the Estonian government by all residents, and this was during a financial crisis (\u0026ldquo;corona\u0026rdquo;). Even though I had no other job, I refused.\nI love Russian films and my native Russian culture in general, Greek songs and culture, Ukrainian culture, and much more. I take what I like from everyone, and I learn\u0026hellip; I learn from everything\u0026hellip; including my beloved cat Murka-Alice and from children.\nI love helping others, finding win-win solutions so that everyone benefits\u0026hellip; fortunately, my experience allows me to find common ground with any person, regardless of their social status, cultural background, or level of adequacy.\nI value everything natural, living, and am calm about social games, conditions, and things.\nI know what it means to starve\u0026hellip;\nI saw the country I was born in collapse — the S/USSR, and what it’s like to go through all that as a child\u0026hellip; how people lose their minds, how their support crumbles\u0026hellip; the psyche can’t handle it, hunger, maniacs, crime, drugs, ideology, looting of factories and everything within reach, exhausting work for pennies, poverty, constant changes in history, rules, and much more.\nWhen I grew up and lived in many places, figuring out how socio-economic systems work and how the \u0026ldquo;influential uncles\u0026rdquo; play their games, the results of which become wars, revolutions, and much more\u0026hellip; as I became an adult uncle\u0026hellip; I don’t want anyone to go through what I did because of their games\u0026hellip; no child should suffer from adult games, and I don’t care what territory it happens in. If the \u0026ldquo;uncles\u0026rdquo; want to, I’ll devise a game for them to play without involving the innocent, I have no problem with how adults consciously handle their lives. I’ve practiced quite extreme practices and it’s unlikely that I can be surprised by anything.\nI am categorically against collapse and revolutions\u0026hellip; especially in Russia, under the noble pretexts of democracy, justice, etc. I am also against puppet politicians anywhere.\nPart 7 About the Path. From the bunker, I looked far and deep\u0026hellip; as much as I could, but maybe my reader wants to look further and deeper, great! Reach out if you have questions, I’ll help as much as I can — but now I want to play a little with others\u0026hellip; with social symbols\u0026hellip; anthems\u0026hellip; flags\u0026hellip; money\u0026hellip; statuses and other games we take so seriously. It’s interesting how money is such an important toy for us\u0026hellip; but \u0026ldquo;nobody knows what money is\u0026rdquo; (c)\u0026hellip; Sanya, not just money\u0026hellip; we can’t define anything\u0026hellip; there will always be a follow-up question-clarification/special case\u0026hellip; it’s impossible to ask the \u0026ldquo;final question\u0026rdquo; (hello Socrates!). The basis is faith.\nAbsolute evil exists. These entities \u0026ldquo;feed\u0026rdquo; on the energy of innocent souls, primarily children. There are people more competent than me in such matters. I’ve reached the level of understanding that’s sufficient for me to act in my earthly life.\nI challenge evil — darkness:\nfirst of all the evil, darkness, and ignorance inside me, which entered through my weaknesses, ignorance, laziness, fear\u0026hellip; as I \u0026ldquo;illuminate inside myself\u0026rdquo; my inner space, and as additional resources (psychological-emotional-physical-material-social and others) appear, I will direct everything I can toward the \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo; and outside\u0026hellip; if God allows, I will reach the darkest places that exist in a person\u0026rsquo;s soul and its material manifestation\u0026hellip; I am not satisfied with the fact that there are places where defenseless, needy people suffer in our time. I think humanity can come up with something better — how we all can live together and get along. With anyone who is willing to negotiate (even pedophiles who do not want to involve children in their fantasies and psychological deviations, even fraudsters, anyone\u0026hellip;): I am ready to speak openly and find common ground, devising a mutually beneficial coexistence format.\nThe criteria for whom I’m willing to negotiate with:\na person tries to follow God’s commandments (the confession doesn’t matter); if non-believer: values: truth-freedom-love and/or a \u0026ldquo;Creator\u0026rdquo; person, creation a principle of non-violence against another being We must understand who the \u0026ldquo;opponent\u0026rdquo; is: some people consciously serve \u0026ldquo;darkness\u0026rdquo; and devote all their strength to this service. There are people 100 times smarter than me, more influential, enduring, insightful, cunning, who know and use people\u0026rsquo;s ignorance for their purposes, mimicking \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo; and much more\u0026hellip; They act together, trying to divide us, guided by the principle: \u0026ldquo;divide and rule\u0026rdquo; (c). Some of them perform open rituals of worship to \u0026ldquo;darkness.\u0026rdquo;\nFor those uncomfortable with \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; rhetoric, I can translate everything into \u0026ldquo;secular language,\u0026rdquo; feel free to ask.\nMy Path. Building \u0026ldquo;Bridges\u0026rdquo;.\nBridges come in different forms. For example, bridges between 1 (who came out of the \u0026ldquo;bunker\u0026rdquo;) and people. Also, bridges may be needed within a person between conflicting parts of themselves; or even to \u0026ldquo;build a bridge\u0026rdquo; to a part of a person they didn\u0026rsquo;t know existed. Finally, bridges may be needed between groups of people.\nI look with a horizon of 10-25 years and further ahead. Current politicians, the \u0026ldquo;big uncles,\u0026rdquo; will \u0026ldquo;finish playing,\u0026rdquo; but we and our children will continue to live, negotiate, and solve problems together\u0026hellip; if nothing changes, many will hate each other. My goal is to build a platform-\u0026ldquo;bridge\u0026rdquo; so that people can implement any existing form of interaction in just a few mouse clicks, but more importantly, so they can quickly change the forms of interaction considering the feedback from \u0026ldquo;reality,\u0026rdquo; and try new collaboration formats to solve old and new problems.\nI am convinced that the key to our prosperity and survival, ultimately, is our ability to negotiate, to find mutually beneficial forms of cooperation. Transparently, predictably, and clearly, with the ability to quickly make decisions and adapt to changes. With those willing to negotiate, and for those who aren’t but are aggressive, we must unite and fight if attacked.\nTo be able to negotiate, you first need to know yourself: who are you and why are you here? How can you know what to ask of another if you don’t know what YOU want? Maybe your desire was imposed on you by advertising, fashion, \u0026ldquo;cool guys from the block\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; Therefore, real change is only possible by increasing your level of awareness, knowledge\u0026hellip; primarily about yourself.\nThe path does not imply that I will tell anyone how to live, but awakening the \u0026ldquo;A,\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;Creator\u0026rdquo; in each person, helping each one emerge from ignorance (teach me something too) and realize their full potential in this life. If someone needs yachts and islands for this, then we need to cooperate and I will help jointly earn it\u0026hellip; the main thing is not to place too much value on the material\u0026hellip; although you can if you like — it’s your life.\nConclusion. Practicing extreme practice \u0026ldquo;conscious madness\u0026rdquo; in July 2020, I understood and came up with certain things. My goal is to share these ideas through my native Russian culture in the hope that it will help someone live \u0026ldquo;their own life\u0026rdquo; and that \u0026ldquo;we together will leave behind everything no worse than we inherited it from our ancestors.\u0026rdquo;\nMetaphorically, I position myself as the \u0026ldquo;old rat Master Splinter\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; from Ninja Turtles :-)\u0026hellip; for various reasons, I don’t have much health left, and I don’t know how much longer I can be of use, but I have experience, wisdom\u0026hellip; and kindness.\nRegarding nationalism:\nIdeally, we are one big family, and we have one common home, our Earth. I see Russian culture as a kind of metaphorical bridge between all other cultures for mutually beneficial finding of common language, in both literal and figurative senses\u0026hellip; for business and technology, we can use simpler English, for example\u0026hellip; maybe Russian culture can also build a \u0026ldquo;bridge\u0026rdquo; between China and the \u0026ldquo;East\u0026rdquo; and the West, so that we all find common ground without resorting to our old scheme: world war number N\u0026hellip; we’ll see.\nΩ\nYou can book a meeting via Calendly, or via Read.ai, or write to me at Email or in Telegram.\n","date":"May 26, 2024","hero":"/posts/omega/meta-bio/hero.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/omega/meta-bio/","summary":"Fig. 1 The Metaphorical Professor's Dwelling Truth, expressed in form (e.g., written, spoken...), ceases to be truth, including what I am writing... exceptions are usually metaphors, parables, tales, proverbs... music.

(c) Morpheus from the movie \"The Matrix\", who in turn paraphrases Plato Context of this Article It is obvious that AI \u0026ldquo;has arrived,\u0026rdquo; at least AI models. The beginning of the age of AI, as Bill Gates stated in his article from 03.2023, where he describes his vision and expresses hopes for solving humanity’s old and new problems with \u0026ldquo;new tools.\u0026rdquo; There are many articles and other materials on this topic. Since I work in this field myself and have my own vision, I wrote part of this article in 03-05.2023. Due to personal circumstances, I finished and am publishing it only now. In addition to AI, the article raises what I see as the main question, which I will reveal in subsequent publications. I also talk about \u0026ldquo;future scenarios,\u0026rdquo; so I think that 10-12 months after writing, it will become clearer if my reflections were wrong.\nFig. 1. The metaphorical boat we are sailing on (neuroArt) The errors of people with strong minds are particularly frightening because they become the thoughts of many other people. N.G. Chernyshevsky\nWritten: 30.05.2023; Edited: 26.05.2024.\nIntroduction All my articles are numbered, and the index number holds significance. My articles raise philosophical-practical questions and are intended for thoughtful, unhurried reading. The goal is to increase awareness, to provoke thought: perhaps I am raising questions more than answering them. The article \u0026quot;#0: Metaphorical Autobiography or the Professor’s Bunker Stories\u0026quot; serves as an introduction, about the author.\nWhy I am writing this article and why now I felt the desire to express my thoughts in this way, and I hope it is interesting and/or useful to someone. Millions of ordinary people and \u0026ldquo;beings\u0026rdquo; have been impressed by the capabilities of AI models for several years now, with a growing level of amazement, and are (perhaps with some caution) eagerly awaiting the release of the next versions of well-known AI products. Many competent and/or famous people have urgently suggested taking a 6-month pause in AI development.\nSome colleagues in the \u0026ldquo;field\u0026rdquo; offer their vision of the impact that the results of their and our collective work have on society (for example, OpenAI article). A Facebook post by an experienced data engineer, who shared his thoughts on this article, caught my attention.\nHe was extremely surprised by the way events were unfolding and recalled his 2015 conversation with a taxi driver in Tbilisi, where he asked the driver what he would do when soon cars would be driving themselves. He found it surprising that AI technologies would first impact high-paying jobs.\nI find this ironic and worthy of deeper understanding, that a large number of smart people around the world, with good salaries, are working on something whose consequences they themselves do not understand. In this context, the well-known scandal at OpenAI, involving the dismissal of CEO Sam Altman and his return, fits organically: it is ironic that people who cannot foresee the consequences of their own decisions within a single company take it upon themselves to \u0026ldquo;make the world better by creating strong AI\u0026rdquo;. In this context, it is also appropriate to recall Elon Musk\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;renunciation\u0026rdquo; of his \u0026ldquo;brainchild\u0026rdquo; and the ironic transformation of OpenAI into something not so \u0026ldquo;Open\u0026rdquo;. This is a huge contrast to the past: a cobbler knew that if he put in a certain amount of time and effort, there would be shoes, and so on. We could compare our activities to that of experimental scientists, but in this case, the scale of the resources invested (financial, human, etc.) is enormous compared to lone scientists/groups of the past, considering that we do not understand the consequences of the final product. This is what I would like to focus on in the article. I also want to raise a question that I consider the most important.\nA detailed study of individual organs teaches one to forget the life of the whole organism. V. O. Klyuchevsky\nWhat I Want to Share I will present a simple mental model, through metaphors, which can be used to model socio-economic dynamics.\nWho I\u0026rsquo;m Writing For I believe my articles may be of interest to \u0026ldquo;architects\u0026rdquo;, people who operate with meta-mental (and more complex) models. Additionally, perhaps to those who are not accustomed to using varied mental models to understand ongoing processes.\nWhat They Might Find Useful in This Article The reader may discover a different way to think about reality. Accordingly, this could open up the opportunity to see other cause-and-effect relationships.\nAbout the Author I will provide some facts that have influenced the formation of my mental models.\nFoundation: It can be said that \u0026ldquo;every 3 to 6 months, I moved and adapted to another society/country\u0026rdquo; (on an unconscious, and later on a conscious level). For me, things like health, clean air, access to water, food, electricity, a place to sleep (not implying sleep in silence, that’s already a luxury), a quiet place for solitude, peace, having close people; clothing, etc.—all of this is a luxury. I\u0026rsquo;ve changed many social roles. Practiced various spiritual practices. Experienced communication with people from different social strata. I am also a mathematician and have loved numbers since childhood.\nPlaces Lived (more than 2 months): USSR: Mykolaiv, Komsomolsk-on-Dnipro, Beryslav; Ukraine: Mykolaiv, Kramatorsk, Komsomolsk-on-Dnipro, Beryslav; Israel: Kibbutz Yagur, Nesher, Haifa; Switzerland: Lugano; France: Rennes; Greece: Athens; Germany: Berlin. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to many places.\nPhD, topic: Spectral Multi-Modal Data Analysis Methods; scientific advisor: Prof. Michaеl M. Bronstein.\nBon Voyage, Captain! Fig. 2. You are the captain, and this is your Metaphorical Ship The metaphor of steering a ship resonates with me because I have had some experience managing a fishing vessel in the Mediterranean Sea. I will continue this metaphor in the context of steering and modeling society/socio-economic systems. Let’s imagine that all of humanity is sailing on a ship. There are two helmsmen: the Collective Conscious and the Collective Unconscious. But that’s not as interesting: let’s imagine that You, my reader, are also a captain, but of your own ship (Fig. 2), which in some way influences the voyage of the large ship from Fig. 1.\nFirst, let’s describe the laws and rules of motion. For easier memorization and comprehension, these laws will be explained in simple terms. I formulated all the laws myself throughout my life, and they reflect my personal experience, knowledge, and observations. Please use everything I \u0026ldquo;teach\u0026rdquo; wisely and for good.\nI hope, dear reader, that you found it interesting to spend some of your precious life with \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo; while reading this article.\n0. The Law of \"Divine Mystery\" There are events and concepts that do not fit into any law... except the Divine Mystery. The Principle of \"Occam's Razor\" Do not explain something in a complex way if it can be explained simply. If it can be explained more simply without resorting to \"conspiracy theories,\" use that explanation. However, this does not mean that a certain \"conspiracy theory\" is necessarily wrong. 1. The Law of \"Simplification\" or \"Parameterization\" Any phenomenon can be simplified into its components, and after that, you can \u0026ldquo;work with them.\u0026rdquo; In mathematical terms: it can be parameterized by finding a \u0026ldquo;projection\u0026rdquo; onto a suitable \u0026ldquo;coordinate system\u0026rdquo; for the task. Then, you can deal with this limited number of parameters.\n- Animate: Any person is a \u0026ldquo;cosmos\u0026rdquo; and is very complex, so it is easier to group people by \u0026ldquo;classes\u0026rdquo; using characteristics significant for the task (5PFQ, XYZα, Archetypes, Temperament, Zodiac Signs, Socionics, Human Design, Intelligence Quotient, 9 Types of the Enneagram, Marketing Personas, Castes 1, Castes 2, Metaphysical Classes and so on).\n- Inanimate: A phenomenon can be modeled as a Riemannian manifold — an object where at every point there is a \u0026ldquo;tangent plane with a coordinate system\u0026rdquo;; then, \u0026ldquo;project\u0026rdquo; everything onto this \u0026ldquo;plane\u0026rdquo; and use standard mathematical tools there for analysis and manipulations (\u0026ldquo;surface\u0026rdquo; of a picture, space of all pictures, a 3D object, space of 3D objects, graph, space of all comments, space of all texts, space of all \u0026ldquo;artistic styles,\u0026rdquo; space of all \u0026ldquo;music styles,\u0026rdquo; space of all songs, space of all audio signals produced by an artist/musical instrument, space of all smooth functions, space of all operators, and so on).\nJustification: Riemannian geometry and differential geometry, orthogonal functions: Fourier functions, spectral decomposition and others; for example, the existence of the science of psychology, which can find patterns and \u0026ldquo;catalog personalities\u0026rdquo;; the existence and \u0026ldquo;successful\u0026rdquo; application of \u0026ldquo;scripts\u0026rdquo; used by fraudsters; the existence and use of pickup techniques for seduction, and so on.\nFig. 3. Example of several 2D \"parameterizations\" of a 3D globe \u0026ldquo;Well, we can \u0026ldquo;simplify\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;parameterize\u0026rdquo;: but why does this allow us to make any conclusions regarding people? Is a person predictable?\n2. The Law of \"The Matrix\" or \"Oblomov-lite\" We often think and, accordingly, act \"automatically\", \"by templates\", implementing certain \"scenarios\". Like a car, we can automatically switch between different, perhaps very complex \"scenarios\"/\"templates\" to solve familiar tasks without realizing it. Any action or thought beyond existing experience usually causes anxiety, doubts, and requires more effort compared to the habitual. This requires discipline and certain habits, which not all people have developed.\nMindfulness is a tool in overcoming \u0026ldquo;automation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;programming\u0026rdquo; (a bit about mindfulness here, learn for free here).\n- Contributes: any monotonous activity, \u0026ldquo;routine\u0026rdquo;, certain professions: cashier, assembly line worker, etc.\n- Does not contribute: activities requiring critical thinking, influencing people (e.g., salespeople, politicians, marketers, scammers), sabotage and espionage, creative work, investing, etc.\nJustification: automatic thoughts, life scripts, a short article with links to scientific studies on automaticity (for example, this one or this one), \u0026ldquo;Thinking, Fast and Slow\u0026rdquo;, G. Gurdjieff, and others.\nI have my personal observation of what percentage of people or what portion of tasks we have \u0026ldquo;templated\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;automated\u0026rdquo;, which I use for myself; I am not aware of scientific works on this topic, so I will not write these numbers here; I\u0026rsquo;ll just say that I use something similar to the \u0026ldquo;80/20\u0026rdquo; law. Thinking is difficult, that's why most people judge. C.G. Jung\nSo, a person is, to some extent, \u0026ldquo;predictable\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;automated\u0026rdquo;, and by being mindful, this Law of \u0026ldquo;The Matrix\u0026rdquo; can be \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo;. Nowadays, \u0026ldquo;mindfulness\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;trending\u0026rdquo;: many meditate, attend yoga sessions, participate in various trainings, read books, go to psychologists, of which there are plenty, and more. Does this mean that the law is not a law and it barely works?\n3. The Law of \"Echo in the Mountains\" It is a misconception to think of mindfulness as some \"pointed\" action — \"being in the moment\", because mindfulness has a \"shape\", one could say a \"radius\". The \"radius of mindfulness\" can be \"defined\" as \"the distance at which we hear the echoes of our actions, of 'ourselves'… and, in more advanced forms, of our thoughts\": like the echo of your voice in the mountains; some are deaf, some hear their echo a couple of times, and some, perhaps, hear the \"reflection\" of their voice from the cliffs for quite a long time. In other words, the \u0026ldquo;radius of mindfulness\u0026rdquo; is how deeply we perceive cause-and-effect relationships and ourselves/our influence in this space at any given moment and in different contexts. I see, so what many are \u0026ldquo;working on\u0026rdquo;, where \u0026ldquo;they are heading\u0026rdquo; in their practices, is, as a rule, misguided and allows them to \u0026ldquo;calmly\u0026rdquo; continue doing what they would have done anyway. But what about the practices — aren\u0026rsquo;t they supposed to help people understand this and other things?\n4. The Law of \"Controlling the Opposition/Right-Wing\" Any practice (e.g. Vipassana, Wim Hof breathing techniques, silence, Satori, reality testing, psychoanalysis from different schools, working with koans, use of pills/mushrooms/herbs, various types of yoga, therapies, and so on) is a tool. It can be a very powerful tool.\nEvery tool is created to solve specific tasks. Many practices-tools imply the preservation of the \u0026ldquo;status quo\u0026rdquo; when practiced; that is, they are specifically designed to ensure that certain things, especially in the thinking of the practitioner, do not change.\nThis law, I think, is easier to understand for people from \u0026ldquo;structures\u0026rdquo;, sabotage units, political strategists, and others: to control those who disagree with any system (and such people will always exist according to the Laws of the \u0026ldquo;Shooting Stick\u0026rdquo; (confirming their existence) and \u0026ldquo;Bell Curve\u0026rdquo; (describing the number of such people)), it is more beneficial to lead these movements, control their leadership; fund, monitor, and control all their actions: protests, Telegram channels, etc.\nSo one of the ways to preserve the \u0026ldquo;status quo\u0026rdquo;, especially in thinking, is to promote and encourage \u0026ldquo;favorable practices, meditation, the concept of mindfulness, yoga…\u0026rdquo;? What other techniques are used?\n5. The Law of \"The Girl in the Red Dress\" Those with children know that their attention can be directed towards something else so they \u0026ldquo;switch\u0026rdquo; from something \u0026ldquo;undesirable\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s similar with us: a \u0026ldquo;narrative\u0026rdquo; is created for us so that we don\u0026rsquo;t direct our attention to things we \u0026ldquo;shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be paying attention to\u0026rdquo;; as a result, we don\u0026rsquo;t get \u0026ldquo;inappropriate questions or actions\u0026rdquo; in our heads.\nFig. 4. The Girl in the Red Dress from the movie \"The Matrix\" 6. The Law of \"The Driven Horse\" Our socio-economic system is generally designed in such a way that we have as little time as possible to \u0026ldquo;look around\u0026rdquo;, so that \u0026ldquo;unnecessary thoughts or questions\u0026rdquo; do not \u0026ldquo;come to mind\u0026rdquo;.\n7. The Law of \"Attention\" Where your attention is, there you are.\nWe mistakenly think that money, time, and so on are the main resources. Perhaps the most important resource for a person is their attention (this is where I should transition to the soul—the foundation of everything—but I will stick to \u0026ldquo;secular rhetoric\u0026rdquo;). Next comes energy. This is why \u0026ldquo;influencers\u0026rdquo; and others make money. Where there is a lot of attention from people, there is their energy, which, in certain contexts, can be converted into monetary units, for example.\nThis is probably the second most important law.\nWhy is control of attention important?\n8. The Law of \"The Pink Elephant\" A person\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo; is limited by their experience in the broadest sense of the word. What has not been \u0026ldquo;noticed\u0026rdquo; by a person\u0026rsquo;s attention does not exist for them in their consciousness.\nIf a person has never heard or seen \u0026ldquo;pink elephants\u0026rdquo;, they cannot ask to enlist a \u0026ldquo;pink elephant\u0026rdquo; in their \u0026ldquo;army\u0026rdquo;.\nAny change begins with a thought about an idea… and giving it attention.\n9. Einstein's Law on Solving Problems and System Analysis \"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them. We need to move to a higher level to solve them.\" Albert Einstein\nThe same applies to system analysis: you cannot analyze something of which you are a part. First, you need to stop being a participant in the system. That’s why external specialists are invited: to analyze and solve relationship problems, conflicts, personal psychological issues, and so on, as they are not participants in this \u0026ldquo;dynamic system\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;external observers\u0026rdquo;.\n10. The Law of \"Who Calls Names, Is the One to Blame\" Projection in psychology. \u0026ldquo;Good people\u0026rdquo; cannot, as a rule, imagine the intricacy of the thoughts and intentions of \u0026ldquo;bad people\u0026rdquo;. They judge others based on their own experience.\n11. The Law of \"Dao\" When \u0026ldquo;softness\u0026rdquo; appears, so does \u0026ldquo;hardness\u0026rdquo;,\nwhen \u0026ldquo;lightness\u0026rdquo; appears, so does \u0026ldquo;heaviness\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\nOne cannot exist without the other.\n12. The Law of \"The Titanic\" Even if you \u0026ldquo;see the iceberg ahead\u0026rdquo;, there is \u0026ldquo;inertia\u0026rdquo; that prevents an immediate \u0026ldquo;stop\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Inertia\u0026rdquo; exists both in an individual (for example, a person who has smoked for a long time cannot, as a rule, quit immediately… or instantly adopt a new habit—\u0026ldquo;change the course of their ship\u0026rdquo;) and in a large socio-economic system.\n13. The Law of \"The Prophet\" or \"Disruptive Innovation\" If you\u0026rsquo;re doing something that changes the system (primarily shifting people\u0026rsquo;s thinking or focusing attention on what \u0026ldquo;should not\u0026rdquo; be noticed), you\u0026rsquo;ll start having \u0026ldquo;problems\u0026rdquo;. These \u0026ldquo;problems\u0026rdquo; grow in proportion to the \u0026ldquo;seriousness of the threat to the system\u0026rdquo; (for example: cancellation, discreditation, intimidation of you and/or your loved ones, loss of livelihood, \u0026ldquo;strange coincidences\u0026rdquo;, physical death, and whatever else \u0026ldquo;opponents\u0026rdquo;-\u0026ldquo;system beneficiaries\u0026rdquo; can imagine).\nOn the other hand, if you are \u0026ldquo;rewarded\u0026rdquo; as a result of your actions, generally speaking, you\u0026rsquo;re at least not interfering with the \u0026ldquo;system\u0026rdquo;. This is why so-called \u0026ldquo;Disruptive Innovations\u0026rdquo; are often cultivated as an \u0026ldquo;illusion\u0026rdquo;, making the system more resilient and giving it \u0026ldquo;anti-fragility\u0026rdquo; (regarding \u0026ldquo;anti-fragility\u0026rdquo;, I won\u0026rsquo;t make any definitive statements, it needs deeper thought).\n14. The Law of \"People Don’t Change\" People are like people. They love money, but that has always been the case\u0026hellip; Humanity loves money, no matter what it\u0026rsquo;s made of: skin, paper, bronze, or gold. Well, they\u0026rsquo;re frivolous\u0026hellip; so what\u0026hellip; mercy sometimes knocks on their hearts too\u0026hellip; ordinary people\u0026hellip; in general, they resemble their predecessors\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s just the \u0026ldquo;housing issue\u0026rdquo; that spoiled them\u0026hellip; A quote from Woland in the novel Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov\nPeople do change, but the \u0026ldquo;closer to the core of a person, the harder and slower those changes happen.\u0026rdquo;\n15. The Law of \"The Gun that Fires Once a Year\" Any event, even extremely unlikely (for example, winning the lottery, etc.), will almost \u0026ldquo;certainly\u0026rdquo; happen with a large enough number of \u0026ldquo;attempts\u0026rdquo;.\nThe number of such events will usually be described by the Bell Curve, as per Law 16 (although there are specific methods to calculate the expected value of \u0026ldquo;rare variables\u0026rdquo;).\nExplanation: The Law of Large Numbers, Expected value of binomial distribution (with a sufficiently large n), The Infinite Monkey Theorem.\n16. The Law of the \"Bell Curve\" If we look at the distribution of (most) things or events, it will resemble a \u0026ldquo;bell curve\u0026rdquo;, though with its own mean and variance (for example: human height distribution, distance between eyes, number of civilian casualties during an assault, the number of wounded in an attack with different amounts of artillery, IQ distribution, horse weight, etc.).\nExplanation: Naturally, I\u0026rsquo;m referring to normal distribution, Student\u0026rsquo;s distribution, and central limit theorems.\nFig. 5. Normal distribution (μ-mean, σ-variance) 17. The Law of \"80/20\" \u0026ldquo;20% of the effort yields 80% of the result, and the remaining 80% of the effort yields only 20% of the result.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is not covered by the normal distribution is often covered by the Pareto distribution (for example, wealth distribution, word frequency in language, and more).\nExplanation: Pareto distribution, Pareto principle, Pareto curve.\n18. The Law of \"Large Volume\" Any small change in a large system leads to significant absolute changes.\nFor instance, if there is a small hole in a pipe that transports oil, if the pipe transports 10 liters of oil per day, the losses will be minimal. However, if it transports millions of liters, the losses will be significant.\nAnother example: Suppose a Starbucks branch in California determined through an A/B test that switching the positions of cappuccino and americano on the menu increases profit by 0.03%. Now, assume the global revenue of the company is $32 billion. Implementing this change globally could result in an additional $9.6 million in revenue.\n19. The Law of \"The Terminator\" In any mechanical or \u0026ldquo;template-based\u0026rdquo; activity, machines will outperform living beings (for example, humans).\n20. The Law of \"Boiled Frog\" (Special case: \"Overton Window\") Gradual changes are easier to accept than sudden ones; the sign of change, whether positive or negative, is irrelevant. Often, changes may even go unnoticed.\n21. The Law of \"Weak Link\" or \"Bottleneck\" \u0026ldquo;A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.\u0026rdquo;\nIn any closed system (for example, manufacturing, sales, pipelines, automobiles, armies, logistics, etc.), there is a \u0026ldquo;bottleneck\u0026rdquo; (BN) that limits the flow of resources through the system. The functioning of the system can be visualized as the flow and transformation of resources. Identifying and eliminating the BN optimizes the system\u0026rsquo;s operation.\nAdditionally, the strength of a system is determined by its weakest component.\nAttention: the theory of constrained systems/BN only partially applies to humans or, more generally, Socio-Economic Systems (SES). In SES dynamics, there are often \u0026ldquo;funnels\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;magnets\u0026rdquo;, and spirals and fractals of spirals and funnels are common.\nExplanation: \u0026ldquo;Theory of Constraints\u0026rdquo;\n22. The Law of \"Whirlpool\" In a person\u0026rsquo;s sphere of influence, there may be \u0026ldquo;whirlpools\u0026rdquo;. You can imagine this as your ship sailing in an area with strong \u0026ldquo;currents\u0026rdquo; caused by one or more \u0026ldquo;whirlpools\u0026rdquo;. This metaphor explains why it\u0026rsquo;s so difficult and sometimes nearly impossible to escape a context in certain situations (for example, when people take on a social role, get involved in \u0026ldquo;ideologies/cults/riots\u0026rdquo;, etc.).\nI will write more about this in the article on complex mental models; there it will become clear why the theory of BN doesn\u0026rsquo;t apply.\n23. The Law of the \"Flock Magnet\" It is difficult to go against everyone or the majority, to resist widely accepted opinions.\n24. The Law of the \"Ladder in a (Chinese) Cinema\" Suppose we\u0026rsquo;re sitting in a cinema. If the people in front of us bring cushions, we will need to sit on something to compensate for the increased height to be able to see. The higher those in front sit, the higher we must sit as well.\nMany processes in life fit this example: using AI/digitization/advertising in business, using drones/satellites/EW in warfare, and so on. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use the \u0026ldquo;ladder\u0026rdquo;, you will be at a disadvantage (unable to \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo;).\nI first heard this example from a Chinese woman who told me about their proverb.\n25. The Law of \"Wait, You Can Do That?!\" A new, better way of achieving previous or better results is quickly adopted by other \u0026ldquo;players\u0026rdquo;. This law is also closely linked to Law 24, as otherwise, you\u0026rsquo;d be at a disadvantage, continuing to do things the \u0026ldquo;old way.\u0026rdquo;\nExamples: first-time use of a subscription-based business model (now considered standard); drones in warfare, and more.\nFig. 7. The famous meme that inspired the name of Law 25. 26\u0026hellip;.41. Law: \u0026hellip;\nLaws that are not mentioned. Feel free to suggest missing laws in a feedback form convenient for you.\n42. The Law of ॐ This is the most complex law; it was told to me. I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand it until I did an extreme spiritual practice.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think most will understand it, so I’ll limit myself to these words:\nThe living is a source of \u0026ldquo;waves\u0026rdquo;: our brain typically finds plausible explanations for what has already been \u0026ldquo;decided\u0026rdquo; on the \u0026ldquo;wave\u0026rdquo; level. Humans are \u0026ldquo;membranes\u0026rdquo;: they receive and transmit electromagnetic waves. All people (the living) are connected and influence each other. Through certain wave signals, one can influence people, \u0026ldquo;synchronize,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;conduct.\u0026rdquo; Explanation: The closest (practical) example I found is in this video.\nŌm The Paradox of \"Socrates\" \"All I know is that I know nothing.\" (Allegedly) Socrates\n\"The best knowledge is not knowing that you know something.\" Lao Tzu\n\u0026ldquo;99.99%\u0026rdquo; of people believe they \u0026ldquo;know\u0026rdquo; more than \u0026ldquo;Socrates,\u0026rdquo; including me, paradoxically.\nExamples of \u0026ldquo;incomplete\u0026rdquo; thinking:\nObviously, I know what a man/woman is\u0026hellip; Advertising/movies/cartoons/propaganda don\u0026rsquo;t influence me. Scammers won\u0026rsquo;t fool me — that won\u0026rsquo;t happen to me. It\u0026rsquo;s clear what money is; you can read about it in the dictionary. \u0026hellip; Laws can and should be combined.\nThe Beginning of the Journey Let’s examine our ship in Fig. 1.\nWe have a very large, multi-tiered communal ship. Some people work in the \u0026ldquo;engine room\u0026rdquo; or in the kitchen, others ensure the uninterrupted operation of the electronics, some enjoy themselves carefree on the deck, and so on; there are many different rooms here.\nWe know some of the previous routes of the ship (it is important to consider that the information is incomplete, and the \u0026ldquo;course\u0026rdquo; model should be adjusted as new inputs come in). An example of \u0026ldquo;routes\u0026rdquo; includes stories about different situations/civilizations, wars, discoveries, relationships, and statistical data from different strata in various contexts (e.g., the expected failure rate of soldiers during attack/defense in a given situation with a certain amount of ammunition and other variables), and so on.\nBased on Law 1. \u0026ldquo;Simplification\u0026rdquo; and Law 17. \u0026ldquo;80/20\u0026rdquo;, there is a limited number of \u0026ldquo;parameters\u0026rdquo; explaining the \u0026ldquo;route of our ship.\u0026rdquo; Additionally, from Law 14. \u0026ldquo;People Don’t Change\u0026rdquo;, we can infer that if these \u0026ldquo;parameters\u0026rdquo; are closer to the \u0026ldquo;center,\u0026rdquo; they change much more slowly than the \u0026ldquo;external\u0026rdquo; ones. Finally, from Law 12. \u0026ldquo;Titanic\u0026rdquo;, it follows that \u0026ldquo;movement along the route\u0026rdquo; has a \u0026ldquo;highly inertial nature.\u0026rdquo; So, what are these \u0026ldquo;parameters\u0026rdquo; close to the \u0026ldquo;center,\u0026rdquo; which largely determine our \u0026ldquo;collective journey\u0026rdquo;?\nIt seems to me that these are our values and meanings. That is, values and meanings, both explicitly stated and real, serve as indicators and beacons for the direction of our \u0026ldquo;movement toward various islands.\u0026rdquo; By \u0026ldquo;islands,\u0026rdquo; I mean where we \u0026ldquo;end up\u0026rdquo; as a result of \u0026ldquo;our voyage\u0026rdquo;; we may \u0026ldquo;linger\u0026rdquo; on some of them, and avoid others, if \u0026ldquo;upon closer approach\u0026rdquo; we see that the \u0026ldquo;island is not so pleasant\u0026rdquo; — if we manage to \u0026ldquo;swerve away,\u0026rdquo; according to Law 12. \u0026ldquo;Titanic\u0026rdquo;.\nExamples of values or meanings (often the distinction is quite conditional):\ncost optimization, profit, ROI\u0026hellip; money: dollars, euros, rubles; cryptocurrencies\u0026hellip; luxury: yachts, watches, brands, gold, diamonds\u0026hellip; success: social approval: titles, certificates, followers, authorship of books/articles, co-authorship with famous people\u0026hellip; material signs: car brands, housing location, beautiful women, mistresses\u0026hellip; health avoidance: pain, shame, fears, humiliation\u0026hellip; pursuit: pleasure\u0026hellip; resources: electricity, gas, oil\u0026hellip;; food, water\u0026hellip; being trendy, first being popular feeling part of something bigger possessing the \u0026ldquo;exclusive\u0026rdquo;: intellect, talent, clothing style, appearance, diamonds, art\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; In today’s journey across the ocean, we will encounter only two types of islands: \u0026ldquo;1+1=2\u0026rdquo; type islands and \u0026ldquo;1+1\u0026gt;2\u0026rdquo; type islands.\nVMC Movement: Value-Meaning-Centric Movement Definition 1. The parameters under consideration that determine the dynamics of societal development — the \u0026ldquo;movement of our ship\u0026rdquo; from Fig. 1.\nIslands of the type \u0026ldquo;1+1=2\u0026rdquo;: On this island, we encounter events or things that are charted on the \u0026ldquo;onboard maps\u0026rdquo; along the course of the VMC movement of our ship, with a significant probability of their existence on the island.\nSome examples of things or phenomena I have found on \u0026ldquo;1+1=2\u0026rdquo; islands include: drones, Tesla, Starlink, deep learning, geometric deep learning, Transformers, Large Language Models, ChatGPT 1-4, Google, etc.\nIslands of the type \u0026ldquo;1+1\u0026gt;2\u0026rdquo;: These are islands that are encountered unexpectedly — non-obvious events or processes that fundamentally change our existence on the ship.\nOn \u0026ldquo;1+1\u0026gt;2\u0026rdquo; islands, I have come across electricity, the steam engine, atomic energy, the internet, blockchain, possibly the smartphone, and so on.\nA Mini VMC Cruise Towards the Islands of \u0026ldquo;Power and Influence\u0026rdquo; The value of power and influence is shared by many people across different continents. In practice, though not always in words, these values often take precedence over the value of other human lives, and so on. As long as this remains true, there will be wars, violence, the seizure of resources and values, not to mention the psychological satisfaction from the process and the result (read: I/we are cooler, stronger, smarter, richer, more democratic than everyone else, etc.). The value of achieving goals with minimal resources is also widespread — meaning it’s highly probable that people will continue to improve in this direction.\nThis has been relevant for a long time — so it’s logical to assume that we will continue to encounter \u0026ldquo;1+1=2\u0026rdquo; type islands on our VMC journey, with various manifestations of the aforementioned attributes. Along this VMC path, on the \u0026ldquo;1+1=2\u0026rdquo; type islands, we will find things/tools for quickly neutralising people/obstacles with minimal resources, new flying/swimming/jumping/loitering/underwater and other such apparatuses for these same purposes, in new mediums (space, Mars, under/over water, consciousness, soul, etc.). On these islands, we will come across new tools to influence consciousness (because it’s easier to neutralise a person by influencing their consciousness in a way that makes them controllable/friendly at an early stage), biology/DNA, possibly wave/laser/bacterial/DNA modifiers of an ethnic group, and other such instruments. We don’t yet have names for all such phenomena, only a few — combat drones, nuclear weapons, electronic warfare, Starlink, etc. But we know that the probability of discovering such tools is very high during this VMC journey.\nSimilarly, we can undertake VMC journeys in other directions: AI, healthcare systems, financial systems, education, and so on.\nExample of a Journey to \u0026ldquo;1+1=2\u0026rdquo; Type Islands: Kandinsky 7.0 and ChatGPT 42.0 As with any journey, we need to prepare well in advance, study the experiences and routes of previously discovered islands, and gather tools and provisions, so to speak.\nHow new machine learning models work and where their application boundaries lie, in simple terms Almost any task we have (translation, facial recognition, text generation, etc.) can be represented as a function or a functional (where the input is a function, and the output is some number, meaning any function \u0026ldquo;shoots\u0026rdquo; a number). We can encode this function using numbers — in other words, this is the mathematical modeling of the task.\nElementary functions, which are the foundation of deep learning models, and how they are combined into a unified structure allow us to encode patterned structures of the task at hand (this is especially apparent in tasks involving computer vision).\nFigure 3. Illustration of patterns learned by functions at different depths of a neural network Approximation theorems serve as theoretical justification for applying deep learning models to practically any task. Patterns and transformation functions are expressed through the model\u0026rsquo;s parameters:\nDefinition 2. Schematic illustration of how learning models work The general idea behind training modern models is finding patterns and mapping function parameters (transformations of patterns and intermediate data) that minimize errors on training data within the selected mathematical model. For sequential data (text, time series, etc.), we can add \u0026ldquo;contextual\u0026rdquo; information (there is a dictionary, and for each data point, we assign weights to relevant data from the dictionary/patterns: a high weight near a word means it is more relevant for the given point/pattern). This is commonly referred to as transformers/attention, but I prefer the term \u0026ldquo;contextual information\u0026rdquo; because that’s what our brain does when trying to understand something — it looks at the \u0026ldquo;context\u0026rdquo; beyond the direct meaning(s). We then learn the mapping from patterns + contexts to/from the original data. We can omit some mapping functions — in this construction, they will be constants. In short, this is what we are doing right now.\nNote that because values and meanings are significantly fewer in number than their manifestations, and due to their relative stability (read: they don’t change quickly, as a rule), the number of parameters we need to keep in mind in our mental model of the world is simplified. Additionally, processes are differentiated into important and less important ones, and finally, they \u0026ldquo;slow down\u0026rdquo; proportionally to the rate at which values/meanings change.\nThe Limitations of Model Application We are limited by the patterns the model has learned and the transformation functions it uses. If a phenomenon is generated by a different \u0026ldquo;pattern,\u0026rdquo; we will only get a projection of that phenomenon onto the manifold of possibilities expressed by the model. If our mapping function from \u0026ldquo;patterns\u0026rdquo; to the manifold of describable phenomena is \u0026ldquo;poorly learned,\u0026rdquo; we end up with a \u0026ldquo;hallucination\u0026rdquo; — a result that does not belong to the manifold of phenomena we are modeling/describing. Since the combination of context/meaning is infinite (and the variations of patterns correspondingly so), this method of modeling will never create true artificial intelligence; there will always be that \u0026ldquo;uncovered 1%\u0026rdquo; of cases. This is similar to expressing a signal through some \u0026ldquo;damping\u0026rdquo; basis, such as the Fourier series: how many basic elements do we need to express any function? All of them!\nThe development of artificial intelligence requires a fundamentally different approach to modeling\u0026hellip; ultimately, our brain. And by the way, why do we even need artificial intelligence? For me, the answer is not obvious.\nFor those interested in this topic, Alexey Redozubov (@AlexeyR @habr) has done some interesting research on an alternative path to AI development.\nCollective Consciousness Reality is \u0026ldquo;wider\u0026rdquo; than any language; moreover, language largely shapes our reality. Collective consciousness is the maximum number of models based on our brains. A strong artificial intelligence with enhanced computational capabilities might offer us a new experience of living in reality.\nWhat will the Value and Meaning Movement of the ship look like: how will the visit to the islands \u0026ldquo;1+1=2\u0026rdquo; under the names Kandinsky 7.0 and ChatGPT 42.0 reflect on our society? As we sail along the planned course, there will be an increasing \u0026ldquo;bite\u0026rdquo; taken out of the templated nature of our collective consciousness, with gradual materialization according to the principle of least resistance (it is easier to replace the mental than the physical). Models will increasingly capture more patterns. According to Law 2: \u0026ldquo;The Matrix\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Light Oblomov\u0026rdquo;, since people tend to think quite automatically, Law 17: \u0026ldquo;80/20\u0026rdquo; will likely apply, repeating the same over the remaining \u0026ldquo;areas\u0026rdquo; — with the previously mentioned \u0026ldquo;uncovered 1%\u0026rdquo; of cases.\nAs our ship sails the AI winds, we will accelerate: patterned tasks will be completed faster, new patterns will be discovered. The obstacle will often not be technology itself but rather the lack of knowing what to do with the \u0026ldquo;freed-up people\u0026rdquo; — until a new purpose for them is found, of course.\nIt is worth noting that unlike previous technological revolutions, this one is fundamentally different because we are replacing models (and, if we follow the logic of Value and Meaning Movement, robots) with our collective consciousness itself, and only then, as a consequence, other social phenomena (interactions in work, writing texts, etc.) — in other words, we are automating the foundation of foundations. Accordingly, any activity that can be templated or mapped into an algorithm of actions can be automated. This means that we won’t be able to invent work for people unless it is creative (non-templated) or \u0026ldquo;roughly\u0026rdquo; physical (until we learn to make bio-robots/robots).\nWhether the phenomena found on the islands during our journey will be named ChatGPT 42.0 or Kandinsky 7.0 is not so important. It is clear that these are islands of the type \u0026ldquo;1+1=2\u0026rdquo; and that future \u0026ldquo;versions\u0026rdquo; of such models will possess the aforementioned properties.\nA notable example is the experience of a business consultant who programmed business processes and decision-making in a large company, resulting in 90% of the top management being redundant and consequently laid off (90% of situations were standard and could be resolved without involving upper management).\nDuring the journey, it is very likely we will encounter an island of the type \u0026ldquo;1+1\u0026gt;2\u0026rdquo; — a fundamentally different way of modeling\u0026hellip; the brain.\nClear examples of the presence of patterns, which are becoming more apparent in everyday activities, accelerating our movement: patterning in the work of Data Scientists/Engineers, patterns in miro, Notion, Evernote, presentations, business: 55 business model patterns, etc. Essentially, all books on how to be successful, make friends, present material, etc., are about learning patterns in different areas (and most of them boil down to the same internal patterns and experiences, but that\u0026rsquo;s another topic).\nTypically, we self-identify — meaning we \u0026ldquo;stick\u0026rdquo; to our mental model, which is why advertising campaigns, propaganda, television, diversionary operations, and so on are so effective — they mainly rely on meta-mental models. Pulling a person out of a calm state into an emotional one (for example, triggering fear, psychological trauma, complexes, humiliation, dislike, pride, etc.) reduces awareness and, as a result, activates their mental model, limiting the ability to think critically.\nCriticism and Limits of This Mental Model This is a very simple model that does not take into account many aspects: consciousness, collective consciousness/unconsciousness, spirituality, and others. The model fully relies on a \u0026ldquo;positivist scientific view,\u0026rdquo; meaning the more we know, the more accurate the model becomes. Ideally, having access to \u0026ldquo;closed\u0026rdquo; information would allow many crises and wars to belong to the \u0026ldquo;1+1=2\u0026rdquo; island rather than the \u0026ldquo;1+1\u0026gt;2\u0026rdquo; island, at least long before arrival. We would then have a higher likelihood of knowing which island we are approaching. It is advisable to use different mental models depending on the task and context. Professions that contribute to the application of more complex models include: psychologists/psychiatrists, sociologists, intelligence services/diversion operations, marketers/branding specialists, trust-based scammers/social engineers, philosophers/spiritual practitioners, investors (G. Soros, C. Munger, W. Buffet), strategic politicians (V. Surkov, A. Arestovich, Z. Brzezinski, etc.), and others (\u0026ldquo;Professor Moriarty\u0026rdquo;). In parentheses, I have listed examples of people who, based on my observations, most likely use more advanced mental models, which we will call meta-mental models. There are many meta-mental models (example of a meta-mental model presented by Felix Shmidel). In the context of such models, other mental models are also operated to represent reality. Ideally, if there is an opportunity to influence society\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;reality\u0026rdquo; through collective consciousness, staying in the shadows is the most advantageous, and it is thought that many people with incredibly complex meta-mental models are unknown to us and familiar only to a very narrow circle of people. It is worth noting that now, in addition to these people\u0026rsquo;s highly complex models, closed information, and advanced modern knowledge about brain structure and the ability to influence collective consciousness, AI technologies are also being added (Palantir \u0026amp; Co, etc.). I will point out that the most complex type of models is spiritual meta-mental models. Beyond them lies the spiritual itself. Based on observations, individuals like A. Arestovich, V. Surkov, V. Putin; G. Rasputin, G. Gurdjieff, Osho, I. Stalin, Joan of Arc (historical figures), and others fall into this category. One of the many complexities in understanding their mental worldview is that their main values and meanings often lie beyond the material world, and in their uniqueness. Consequently, while most people attach great importance to houses, yachts, money, and other material possessions, for these individuals, those things likely have a completely different significance—they invest different symbols into them. Since we mostly evaluate based on our worldview, the difficulty in understanding arises from this. Indeterminism: any mental model is a probabilistic model (though the probability may be nearly 100%). Why It\u0026rsquo;s Important to Start Rethinking How and Why We Interact with Each Other The pursuit of high margins leads to situations where even a trip to a mistress becomes a military operation. F. Shmidel\nIn the realm of \u0026ldquo;doing,\u0026rdquo; especially templated or repetitive actions, any machine will outperform us; see 19. Law \u0026ldquo;Terminator.\u0026rdquo; The templates may be non-trivial and very complex, but sooner or later, new models will learn these too (many of these templates may surprise most people). Within the framework of our current interactions, we have now reached a point where we can teach machines complex templates and sophisticated mapping functions, taking into account contextual information.\nWe need to decide: will we continue our CsM-movement on our ship under the same winds, or\u0026hellip;?\nWill we see those \u0026ldquo;others\u0026rdquo; who may be weaker/slower/less foresighted, who have not yet learned or whose time hasn\u0026rsquo;t come to operate with meta-mental models, as merely a source of benefits for achieving goals, \u0026ldquo;batteries\u0026rdquo; for resources, \u0026ldquo;bio-robots\u0026rdquo;? Or will we recognize the inherent value in them as living beings?\nSimply because, in this vast galaxy, a miracle has occurred—before us is a living being that, for some reason, appeared here just like you, my dear reader!\nPlease note that I have not even touched on (geo-political) conflict questions, assuming that we are capable of negotiating with one another.\nSummary: Our socio-economic system is unbalanced and inevitably leads to the stratification of society (both within countries and on a global level), which will ultimately result in segregation (presumed classes: \u0026ldquo;elite,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;service class\u0026rdquo; (physical, \u0026ldquo;spiritual,\u0026rdquo; and intellectual), \u0026ldquo;security,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;bio-mass\u0026rdquo;). Although it is already showing cracks, it is unclear what form it will take in the next 2-10 years. AI and automation significantly accelerate the aforementioned dynamics of wealth distribution. AI and automation are a revolution in the means of production, which will inevitably lead to social tension and conflict between different social classes. Elites, in most cases, are just like us; we all worry about our savings, quality of life, and our children\u0026rsquo;s futures, and we act based on our mental models and experiences. The pursuit of wealth by I. Musk, B. Gates, W. Buffett, R. Abramovich, J. Bezos, and others beyond what they currently have makes no sense from a numerical standpoint. Whether W. Buffett, for example, has 10 billion more or less will hardly affect his actual standard of living, not to mention the fact that you can\u0026rsquo;t take anything with you. Earning beyond a reasonable measure resembles: I fight... simply because I fight! Porthos\nThe solution, in my view, should be a movement towards a society where everyone can continue doing what they love (e.g., W. Buffett investing, etc.) while maintaining a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; standard of living, but where the means of production, as a result of economic activity, are gradually distributed more evenly through consensual agreements. This would lead to a gradual improvement in wealth distribution.\nRegarding the ability to negotiate:\nWe can't agree on anything, any tool or resource becomes a weapon. A. Kubyshkin\nAny technology, philosophy, concept\u0026hellip; becomes a weapon: democracy, rumors, car/ship insurance, financial accounting protocols, money, life resources, talents, the internet, history, good intentions, and in any medium: Earth, air, water, underwater, space, consciousness, soul\u0026hellip;\nWhat’s Next The main question: Why and how do we interact with each other? within relationships, companies, cities, countries, Earth\u0026hellip; how else can we interact? The answer to this question, it seems to me, lies in deciding what is primary-secondary:\n(a)\nMutual aid (compassion and mercy) Competition or\n(b)\nCompetition Mutual aid (compassion and mercy) If (b), then we should take an example from nature and animals. For instance, a pride of lions, having captured a territory and defeated the previous leaders, first kills the cubs of the former leaders—\nit\u0026rsquo;s easier to get rid of competitors while they\u0026rsquo;re weak, ideally, while they\u0026rsquo;re embryos or not born at all.\nAccordingly, it is most profitable to compete by eliminating the children of our competitors—either by killing them, creating unfavorable conditions for their development, feeding them harmful products, and so on. Instead of blocking Ukrainian products, it would be better to neutralize all Ukrainian, African children entirely. And we should treat others\u0026rsquo; children the same way, teaching them skills that hinder adaptation and development. It\u0026rsquo;s better to develop DNA-based weapons to make women of a particular nationality/group infertile, then we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to fight adult warriors later. Let the profit be with us, for it\u0026rsquo;s the most important thing, isn’t it?\nBut if (a), the direction I see is improving the quality of life (in many dimensions) for all participants—enhancing well-being. The criterion for correct movement is to \u0026ldquo;make it not worse than it was.\u0026rdquo;\nWhatever they say to me,\nI will still say mine:\nWhat lies ahead—who knows,\nBut what\u0026rsquo;s mine—is mine!\nI. A. Krylov\nPerhaps this doesn’t sound too glamorous or ambitious, but in this formula there is also a comparison with what was—taking the best from the past, learning from mistakes and experience, and cautiously moving toward the future.\nTrying to make everything \u0026ldquo;fair\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;equal\u0026rdquo; is a utopia.\nIt’s also a utopia if someone claims I know what\u0026rsquo;s best for everyone—the system governing our ship has become too complex. We should focus on this vector and on the continuous feedback from the passengers of the ship.\nPlease note that with such a movement, passengers will inevitably have to turn their attention inward to understand what they need and whether things have improved, which will inevitably lead to a rethinking of consumer culture and other values. With this direction, we don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need a strong artificial intelligence—an argument made by some thinkers (e.g., for resource allocation); though there is no conceptual contradiction either.\nIn the following articles, I’ll discuss the options we have and why thinking in terms of capitalism and/or socialism and/or \u0026hellip; another \u0026hellip;ism is inherently flawed in its premise.\nLet the profit be with you, for that’s what matters most, isn’t it?\nI’m afraid of becoming like those grown-ups who are only interested in numbers...

Sam Altman | Lex Fridman #367 (ENG), key points: OpenAI has made huge breakthroughs in AI.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note AI risks (according to Lex) — we are on the brink of significant changes (expected within our lifetime).\nThis is inspiring: we know many applications, but many remain unknown. AI could help us defeat poverty and bring humanity closer to happiness, which we all strive for. On what basis is this assumption made? There is the danger that we might be destroyed — akin to 1984 by Orwell or Brave New World by Huxley — losing our ability to think.\nWe need to find a balance between AGI’s potential and its dangers.\nIn 2015, OpenAI declared its goal of working on strong AI, and many in the field laughed or mocked them. Sam admits that poor marketing and branding contributed to this perception.\nLex notes that DeepMind \u0026amp; OpenAI were small groups unafraid to declare their goal of creating AGI.\nSam: Now, nobody mocks us anymore (they used to laugh at the idea of building AGI).\nThis conversation is about power, the psychology of AI creators, and more.\nWhy GPT-4 and what is it?\nSam: GPT-4 is a system we’ll one day look back on and say it was the first AI, slow, buggy, etc., but it will be significant in the future, like computers are today.\nSam: I believe progress is exponential, and we won’t be able to point to a specific moment where AGI happened.\nLex: There\u0026rsquo;s too much data! The bigger problem is filtering it.\nSam: Many pieces need to come together in one pipeline — either by coming up with new ideas or implementing existing ones well.\nLex quotes, \u0026ldquo;ChatGPT teaches something\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo;\nSam: The most important thing is, \u0026lsquo;How useful is it to people?\u0026rsquo;\nLex: I\u0026rsquo;m not sure we\u0026rsquo;ll ever fully understand these models, because they compress the entire internet and texts into a small number of parameters.\nSam: \u0026ldquo;For certain definitions of intelligence and reasoning, ChatGPT can do it at a certain level — it’s somewhat incredible.\u0026rdquo;\nLex: Yes, many would agree, especially those who\u0026rsquo;ve interacted with ChatGPT.\nSam: I agree with the overall ideas.\nLex: Peterson asked ChatGPT if Jordan Peterson is a fascist.\nSam: \u0026ldquo;The questions people ask say a lot about them.\u0026rdquo; Peterson was asking about message lengths and concluded that ChatGPT lies and knows it lies… because it couldn’t count the length of its messages correctly.\nSam: I hope that these models will bring nuance back to life! On what basis is this hope/prediction grounded? Will the model really return objective, well-balanced answers to complex questions? This is not obvious to me, but maybe I\u0026rsquo;m wrong.\nSam: Progress is exponential in nature\u0026hellip; It’s impossible to pinpoint the exact “moment” (of a breakthrough).\nSam: We continue to fine-tune LLM models with feedback from people (reinforcement learning), otherwise, the models wouldn’t be as useful.\nSam: Some things that seem trivial to us are not for the model (e.g., counting the number of characters in a message).\nSam: We release models to the public early because we believe that if this is going to shape the future, collective intelligence will help identify the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; aspects of what the model does.\nWe could never have discovered things inside companies without the feedback from \u0026ldquo;collective intelligence.\u0026rdquo; It’s an iterative process of improvement.\nGPT-4 is much better and less biased than 3.5\u0026hellip; I wasn’t particularly proud of the biases in 3.5. !!! Interesting—what role does ego play here, and what role does the desire to \u0026ldquo;make the world better\u0026rdquo; play? How can you decide what’s better for others if you haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced their challenges (e.g., poverty)? !!!\nSam: There will never be two people who agree on the quality of the model. I think the solution is to eventually give personalized control to individuals over the model.\nSam: I always dreamed of building AI, but I didn’t think I’d have the chance to do it.\nI couldn’t imagine, after the very first \u0026ldquo;primitive\u0026rdquo; iteration, that I’d have to spend my time answering people’s concerns about the model’s performance: \u0026ldquo;How many characters are in the answer to a question about two different people?\u0026rdquo; (hinting that this doesn’t matter much). \u0026ldquo;You give people AGI, and that’s what they focus on?!\u0026rdquo; So, you’re building something incredibly powerful, making it accessible to everyone, and you don’t know what they’ll do with it\u0026hellip; Maybe we should decide what we want to do with this first before creating it? !!! This is very important (comments about character counts and similar things). !!! Contradiction with previous statements; political correctness or lack of sincerity? !!!\u0026hellip; Perhaps\u0026hellip; But I wouldn’t have guessed that in advance! Is he trolling? What else might happen that you haven’t anticipated? Worst-case scenario? Best? Most likely?\nLex: How much do you spend on safety concerns?\nSam: We invest a lot in \u0026ldquo;alignment\u0026rdquo; (safety, reducing bias, doing \u0026ldquo;all good things against all bad things\u0026rdquo;). I\u0026rsquo;m proud of the work done on GPT-4 and the tests we conducted. (!!! He didn’t specify how much exactly. !!!)\nLex: Could you share your experiences with alignment?\nSam: We still haven’t found a way to do alignment for super-powerful systems.\nNot everyone understands the nuances, and the challenge of alignment is as complex as all the other work we’re doing in creating and making these models useful (like DALL·E).\nSam: We need to come to an agreement on the boundaries of these models (what’s good/bad).\nPeople will have control over what they can do, depending on the query (e.g., \u0026ldquo;answer like xxx\u0026rdquo;). Prompt engineering: learning from interaction.\nLex: Since this is based on \u0026ldquo;our\u0026rdquo; data, we might learn something about ourselves.\nWith experience, the system gets smarter and smarter, and it feels more like communicating with a person.\nLex: I think LLM/ChatGPT will change the \u0026ldquo;nature\u0026rdquo; of programming/how we program.\nSam: This is already happening, and it’s the biggest short-term change (allowing people to do their jobs and creative tasks better and better). !!! Better or faster? Will this kill creativity in the long run? Will this atrophy the skills needed to develop expertise, such as the long road of becoming a skilled programmer after being inexperienced? !!!\nLex/Sam: You can ask for code generation, and in new systems, you can iteratively improve it by \u0026ldquo;conversing with the model.\u0026rdquo; A new way of debugging?\nSam: A creative-dialogue partner\u0026hellip; This is a very big thing! !!! He views it as an assistant\u0026hellip; But why do things faster? Is it always necessary to do them faster and more efficiently? What are the long-term consequences: What qualities and skills will these systems foster in our children/next generations? Will it lead to laziness? If something can be done in a few clicks, why bother to exert effort? !!!\nThey’re trying to define what \u0026ldquo;hate speech\u0026rdquo; is, and what models should do with hate and other human qualities.\nThey bring up the example of a constitution as an analogy for a social contract\u0026hellip; created democratically. !!! Are we sure democracy is what’s needed in this context? If you let children decide, they will eat candy and play games\u0026hellip; Hitler came to power through democratic elections\u0026hellip; What’s the foundation for this assumption? !!!\nLex: How bad is the baseline model — Sam dodged the answer. !!! Openness means being transparent, especially about unpleasant things. !!!\nSam: We’re open/welcome criticism\u0026hellip; I’m not sure I understand all the consequences of how criticism affects us\u0026hellip; I’m not sure.\nSam: I don’t like when a computer \u0026ldquo;teaches\u0026rdquo; me\u0026hellip; It’s important to remember that I \u0026ldquo;control\u0026rdquo; the process, and I can \u0026ldquo;throw out\u0026rdquo; the computer. !!! Not sure if he\u0026rsquo;s sincere here or just playing to people’s fear of losing control\u0026hellip; maybe it’s a smart salesperson\u0026rsquo;s manipulation — showing that he understands and shares your fears\u0026hellip; He’s like you\u0026hellip; You\u0026rsquo;re in the \u0026ldquo;same boat.\u0026rdquo; !!!\nI often say in the office that we should treat people like adults. !!! What’s this assumption based on? What does it mean to be an adult? Empirical data shows that not everyone is psychologically mature (whatever that means\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ll leave definitions aside here); this also contradicts the earlier statement that \u0026ldquo;models will bring nuance back to discussions,\u0026rdquo; implying the model will play the role of \u0026ldquo;teacher/adult\u0026rdquo;: so is the model supposed to teach people or not? Are we sure the majority of people are adults? This is fundamental to understanding how we should interact with people. !!!\nSam: The difference between ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 is huge. We at OpenAI are good at finding small technical improvements, and with enough incremental improvements, we got GPT-4 (improvements at every step).\nLex and Sam discuss the training cost and the number of parameters in AI models, comparing it to the number of connections in the brain. Sam emphasizes how impressive it is that the AI model has been trained on all human data produced throughout history, compressing the entire human experience into its parameters.\nLex asks about the number of parameters in the model. Sam explains that OpenAI focuses on results rather than chasing the number of parameters in the model. \u0026ldquo;We avoid the trap of parameter count competition,\u0026rdquo; he says. Instead, they prioritize making the models work well, although Sam avoids directly answering how many parameters the model has.\nLex brings up Noam Chomsky\u0026rsquo;s critique, who doubts that Large Language Models (LLMs) can lead to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Sam acknowledges that LLMs are part of the equation but insists that other essential pieces are still required. Expanding the paradigm of models like ChatGPT may introduce new ideas that can advance AGI.\nSam reflects on the possibility of ChatGPT reaching AGI status in the future, noting that if an oracle (referencing the ancient Greek Oracle of Delphi) told him that ChatGPT-10 would be AGI, he wouldn’t be surprised. He says \u0026ldquo;It might not require a big breakthrough,\u0026rdquo; but at the same time, AGI might never be achieved. Instead, Sam sees value in making people \u0026ldquo;super great\u0026rdquo; in what they already do, though this raises questions about the current trajectory of humanity, including conflicts and wars.\nSam adds that a system that can’t generate radically new scientific knowledge isn’t a \u0026ldquo;superintelligence.\u0026rdquo; He admits that there is still much to learn. \u0026ldquo;I don’t know what strong AI is, but I want to build it.\u0026rdquo; Interestingly, Sam shares that he has built a bunker to prepare for a potential collapse, hinting at the complexity and potential risks involved with developing such technologies.\nSam expresses excitement for a future where ChatGPT becomes a tool that extends human capabilities and \u0026ldquo;amplifies people\u0026rsquo;s will.\u0026rdquo; However, this raises concerns about preparing for survival scenarios, including building bunkers. If the tool is intended to empower humanity, why focus on survival preparations? Sam\u0026rsquo;s readiness for a collapse contradicts the optimism surrounding AI as a tool for advancing human development. \u0026ldquo;Are we sure we’re not just speeding towards the same old problems?\u0026rdquo; Sam wonders whether we might need to rethink our values and ways of thinking before rushing ahead with technological advancements.\nMeme about AI taking away programmers' jobs Lex: I enjoy programming with AI;\nThere are concerns that AI will take programmers\u0026rsquo; jobs; if it takes your job, it means you\u0026rsquo;re not a good enough worker/programmer - this is only partially true; there is a creative component !!! logically incorrect statement: if 80% of the work is standardized, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what level of programmer you are, it’s cheaper to do it with AI; competence is needed for a small portion of jobs, usually already templated !!! Sam: many programmers are inspired by AI\u0026rsquo;s capabilities, thinking they can be 10x more productive; few are turning off this option !!! this is a typical application of Law 24. \u0026ldquo;Ladders in a (Chinese) cinema\u0026rdquo;: at some point, if you don\u0026rsquo;t use it, you’ll lose in the \u0026ldquo;collective race,\u0026rdquo; so the moment of choice - to turn it off or not - is taken away from a person !!!\nSam: Kasparov, after losing to a computer, said chess was finished, but chess has never been more popular;\nWe don’t watch AI play against each other!!! Are you sure we get more enjoyment from the game? Or maybe the element of \u0026ldquo;surprising/unexpected\u0026rdquo; moves has been lost, replaced by dry computer calculations? Are we sure that by becoming more like \u0026ldquo;machines,\u0026rdquo; life is better/more interesting for us? !!!\nLex: AI will get better and blah blah, but we will need emotions/imperfectness\u0026hellip;\nSam: The extent to which we can raise people\u0026rsquo;s standard of living with AI is just incredible; we can do amazing things!!! On what is this assumption based? Aren\u0026rsquo;t suicide rates higher in Japan/South Korea/Switzerland/Scandinavian countries than in Jamaica/Bali\u0026hellip;? Aren\u0026rsquo;t people dying out there? Are they happier than in places with less wealth? You decide to improve something (standard of living in this case): but what is the cause of this state of affairs? Can you solve a problem without understanding its root cause?! Perhaps if we understand it, AI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be necessary? Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s our greed? Hypocrisy? Lobbying for military factories and their products? The politics of implicit colonization? The use of slave labor in other countries? Provoking wars where it’s profitable for us to gain cheap access to resources (oil, lithium, cobalt, palladium, uranium\u0026hellip;)? Is it profitable for us that other people live in poverty and misery, so we can buy their resources, goods, \u0026ldquo;brains\u0026rdquo; (freelancers) for cheap (like the production cost of Apple phones being less than $20, for example), etc.? Maybe we should understand the cause of the problem before doing anything? !!! but people like to feel useful, the drama\u0026hellip; and we\u0026rsquo;ll find a way to provide that!!! But will AI make them useless?! Maybe we, humans, should decide what we need, and you can focus on your life\u0026hellip; without \u0026ldquo;causing us any good\u0026rdquo;? !!!\nLex: Eliezer Yudkowsky is an example of someone who warns against strong AI, as he believes it will destroy humanity.\nThe main message: it is impossible to control superintelligence. Sam: there is a chance he’s right. We need to focus on solving this problem with an approach: iterative improvement/early feedback-response/limiting \u0026ldquo;one-shot\u0026rdquo; scenarios. Eliezer explained why AI alignment (\u0026ldquo;making AI aligned with human interests\u0026rdquo;) is such a complex problem. Sam believes there are logical flaws (doesn’t specify), but Eliezer\u0026rsquo;s arguments are generally well thought out.\nLex: Will strong AI emerge suddenly or gradually? Will everyday life change?\nSam: I think (Lex agrees) that for the \u0026ldquo;world, it\u0026rsquo;s better for strong AI to emerge gradually and slowly.\u0026rdquo;\nI’m afraid of rapid development of strong AI.\nSam: Do you think GPT-4 is strong AI?\nLex: I think, like with videos of UFOs, we would know immediately. From my interactions with GPT-4, it seems not all its capabilities are available.\nSam: I think GPT-4 is not strong AI!!! dodged the question about unavailable features!!!\nLex: Do you think GPT-4 has consciousness?\nSam: I don’t think so. Do you think GPT-4 has consciousness?\nLex: I think it can pretend to have consciousness.\nLex: I believe AI will have consciousness. How will that work? Will it experience suffering, memory, communication, etc.?\nSam: I’ll refer to what Ilya (Sutskever) said earlier about how we’ll know if a model has consciousness: if there’s nothing in the training data \u0026ldquo;about consciousness,\u0026rdquo; but the model can answer that \u0026ldquo;it understands what consciousness feels like\u0026rdquo; (loosely translated)—then, there you go… (there’s consciousness).\nLex: Consciousness is about experiencing life (Sam thinks consciousness doesn’t include emotions); in the film referenced, a robot/AI smiles to itself (experiencing the experience for the sake of experiencing it) — a sign of consciousness… he claims emotions play an important, possibly leading, role.\nThey can’t provide a clear answer about consciousness.\nLex: What are the reasons that, during the development of strong AI, something might go wrong? What could go wrong? You said you’re very inspired by the developments, but also a little afraid\u0026hellip;\nSam: Yes, I’m a little afraid, but I think it’s strange not to be afraid at all.\nI sympathize with people who are very afraid!!! \u0026ldquo;we’re on the same side, I sympathize with you\u0026rdquo;; this could be an effective communication technique without any real substance!!! !!! did not answer the question !!!\nLex: Do you think you\u0026rsquo;ll recognize the moment when the system becomes super-intelligent?\nSam: My current concerns\u0026hellip;\nThere will be issues with deception/disinformation, economic shocks/crises, something far beyond what we\u0026rsquo;re prepared for. These problems don’t require super AI, and I think not enough attention is being paid to these issues\u0026hellip; even before strong AI!!! He didn’t answer the question but pointed out other things we should worry about before we start talking about strong AI!!!\nLex: So, do you think even scaling current models can change geopolitics, etc.?\nSam: How do we know that, for example, LLMs aren’t already controlling the flow of information/discussions on Twitter, and so on?\nWe can’t know! And that’s the danger\u0026hellip; maybe regulation, stronger AI!!! So, we’ve created a powerful tool for generating deception, made it powerful and \u0026ldquo;smart enough,\u0026rdquo; but can’t control the consequences of its use\u0026hellip; considering how much influence social media, etc., have had — like revolutions triggered through them. Not exactly making the world better\u0026hellip;!!!\nLex: How do you deal with market pressures (big companies like Google, open-source projects, etc.)? How do you prioritize?\nSam: I stick to my beliefs and mission!!! Where did this mission come from? What’s its \u0026ldquo;source\u0026rdquo; or foundation? Hitler and others had a mission too. Are you sure the \u0026ldquo;source\u0026rdquo; of this mission is pure?!!!\nThere will be many strong AIs, and we will offer one of them\u0026hellip; diversity is good. At first, people laughed at us, but we were brave enough to announce that we’re working on strong AI\u0026hellip;!!! Why is it important that you were brave? What role does ego play here, and what part is the desire to help others by making the world better?!!!\nSam: OpenAI has a complex structure\u0026hellip; a nonprofit controls us, but a purely nonprofit structure didn’t work for us. We came to understand that we need some \u0026ldquo;benefits of capitalism.\u0026rdquo;\nI think no one wants to destroy the world, so capitalism, etc., will lead to \u0026ldquo;good angels\u0026rdquo; and companies prevailing in the end!!! This is a logical fallacy\u0026hellip; and a dangerous, unfounded assumption. Consider Hitler\u0026hellip; people commit suicide, people consciously/unconsciously destroy their lives. We need facts, not\u0026hellip;!!!\nWe discuss together and try to mitigate terrible risks.\nLex: No one wants to destroy the world!!! An unfounded assumption!!!\nLex: It might happen that a couple of guys in a room will say to each other, \u0026ldquo;Holy crap!!\u0026rdquo; (upon seeing the results of their work).\nSam: This already happens more often than you might think.\nLex: This could make you the most powerful people in the world; are you worried that power might corrupt you?\nSam: Of course! I think decisions on how to use AI should become more and more democratized (note: more people having a say), but we don’t yet know how this can be done. One reason is to give the world (note: people) time to adapt, reflect, and pass laws.\nSam: It\u0026rsquo;s really bad if one person gets access to these technologies; I do NOT want any privileges in the board of directors!!! What happened to your board of directors?!!!\nLex: Creating strong AI gives immense power.\nSam: (note: asks questions) Do you think we are doing well? What can we improve? On Lex\u0026rsquo;s note about more openness, he asked if opening access to ChatGPT-4 was an option. Lex said no, he trusts many people at OpenAI and believes in them.\nSam: Google probably wouldn’t have opened an API, but we did; maybe we’re not as open as some would like, but we do a lot.\nLex agrees and says they’re less concerned about PR risks and more about the availability of the technology (note: the risks related to its application).\nSam: He claims people at OpenAI feel responsibility!!! To whom?!!! for the results of their work; he shows openness to ideas on how they can do things better and says he gets feedback from conversations like this!!! In interviews? Are the most important issues really discussed here?!!!\nLex: What do you and Elon Musk agree on regarding strong AI?\nSam: We agree on assessing risks and dangers and that as a result of strong AI, people’s lives, in general, should improve compared to if it had never existed!!! How do you think this should be achieved? What role should strong AI play in this?!!! Sam often asks counter-questions to \u0026ldquo;uncomfortable\u0026rdquo; remarks.!!!\nLex: What do you agree and disagree with Elon Musk on regarding AI?\nSam: We agree on the potential risks of strong AI.\nWe agree that after the appearance of strong AI, people on Earth should live better than if strong AI had never been created. Elon attacks us on Twitter and in other ways on several fronts. I empathize with him / sympathize because I think he’s very concerned about the safety issues of strong AI!!! Sam frequently uses this expression — I have sympathy/empathy for\u0026hellip; — perhaps it’s an effective communication tactic without any real emotions behind it!!! I’m sure there are other motives behind his (Elon’s) complaints!!! Is he hinting at some game or dishonesty?!!! I saw an old video of Elon where he talked about SpaceX, and many famous people in the space industry criticized him. Elon said they were his heroes, and it hurt him to be so heavily criticized. He wished they could see how hard they (Elon and co.) were working to make their vision a reality. Elon was Sam’s hero, even though he’s a jerk on Twitter!!! Strong personal judgment.!!! I’m glad he exists, but I wish he would recognize more of our hard work to do things right!!! Very clever communication tactic — using criticism of Elon himself as an example.!!!\nLex: More love! What do you appreciate about Elon Musk in the context of love/acceptance?\nSam: He moved the world forward in significant ways.\nElectric transportation, space\u0026hellip; even though he\u0026rsquo;s a jerk!!! second assessment!!! He\u0026rsquo;s a fun and warm guy.\nLex: I enjoy the diversity (of opinions, people\u0026hellip;) and the real battle of opinions happening on Twitter\u0026hellip;\nSam: Maybe I should respond\u0026hellip; but it\u0026rsquo;s not my style\u0026hellip; (maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll answer someday).\nLex: You both (Sam + Elon) are good people, deeply concerned about strong AI and with a lot of hope and belief in it!!! Maybe we should be more concerned with people rather than technology?!!!\nLex: Quoting Elon Musk, it seems chatGPT is too WOKE (too tolerant, LGBTQ+, gender issues, etc.). Is this a question of bias?\nSam: I don’t even know what WOKE means anymore!!! doubt!!! The first GPTs were too biased; there will never be a version of chatGPT that the world agrees is unbiased!!! Good communication tactic — stating that something is unattainable so as not to answer uncomfortable questions about bias!!!\nWe will try to make the base model more neutral.\nLex: A few words about the bias of the model related to the company\u0026rsquo;s employees?\nSam: There is 100% such bias. We try to avoid being stuck in the \u0026ldquo;San Francisco cognitive bubble.\u0026rdquo; I plan to travel the world and talk to people (clients) in entirely different contexts (as I often did at YC)!!! This shows that he is consciously trying to use meta-mental models, to understand and model other people.!!!\nI think we’re better than others at avoiding the \u0026ldquo;crazy San Francisco bubble,\u0026rdquo; but I still think we’re pretty deep in it!!! Admitting imperfection — a very good communicative tactic; it builds trust and rapport.!!!\nLex: Can you distinguish between the model’s bias and the bias of the employees?\nSam: What worries me the most is the bias of the people who fine-tune the model afterward! This is the part we understand the least.\n-\u0026gt; This is the central and most important point of the entire interview and, in principle, the entire topic: the problem is that we don’t know how to understand and listen to each other. If we don’t solve this, no AI, no strong AI, will help us come to agreements, and we will continue to fight, only now with AI and its derivatives.\n===================================== At this point, I will stop, because:\na. I don’t see the point in writing further if the \u0026ldquo;basis\u0026rdquo; is already clear, and there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough focus on it.\nb. It is energy-consuming, and I’m not sure if it’s interesting or useful to anyone.\nGeneral comments/questions:\nYou are giving people a powerful tool with the level of development and consciousness (values, meanings\u0026hellip;) they have now, which means they will pursue the same needs and purposes as before, but with a new tool. This means that all processes will accelerate: are you sure we\u0026rsquo;re not on the \u0026ldquo;Titanic,\u0026rdquo; speeding up its course? You can\u0026rsquo;t foresee all the outcomes within one company, so why take on the responsibility to think and act for everyone else? What role do your ego and ambitions play here? Is it true that you are building/have built a bunker (like Zuckerberg and others)? If so, why? If we\u0026rsquo;re not on the \u0026ldquo;Titanic,\u0026rdquo; why do you need a bunker? And if we are on the \u0026ldquo;Titanic,\u0026rdquo; why are you speeding it up? Why doesn’t the company’s name reflect its mission: why not open-source the code? How are the models trained? What data do you use? Isn’t the original goal to create OPEN AI for all humanity? Maybe then it should be open-source? These models are trained on the collective work of all humanity (texts, translations, designs, artwork, videos — already in the new model — games, code). Why does someone have the right to claim ownership of these models, which wouldn\u0026rsquo;t exist without the collective labor of all people? Shouldn’t they be open-source then? Universal basic income: a big mistake because it doesn’t take into account human nature — there will be a lot of degradation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Guz73e6fw\n4. Sam Altman | Lex Fridman #419 (ENG), main points and comparison with the first interview: I don\u0026rsquo;t see the point in analyzing the second interview and comparing it with the first—it\u0026rsquo;s unclear if anyone needs or is interested in it.

I define violence as the forcible violation of another\u0026rsquo;s will, but if the participants agree to \u0026ldquo;fight/compete,\u0026rdquo; it is not violence but \u0026ldquo;aggression.\u0026rdquo; The same applies to wars where there is an \u0026ldquo;attack.\u0026rdquo; In this concept, aggression is acceptable, but it is directed toward \u0026ldquo;non-violence\u0026rdquo; and/or \u0026ldquo;defense.\u0026rdquo;\nVecheism Since we \u0026ldquo;love\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;..isms,\u0026rdquo; I propose calling the implementation of method 1 \u0026ldquo;Vecheism.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Vecheism\u0026rdquo; is a mechanism for reaching \u0026ldquo;contractual\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;collective consensus\u0026rdquo; to solve \u0026ldquo;collective cognitive tasks\u0026rdquo; (including a \u0026ldquo;force component\u0026rdquo; to avoid \u0026ldquo;Fig. 3\u0026rdquo;).\nFig. 5 \"Vecheism\" as an \"organizational constructor\" Fig. 6 A \"slider\" graph for \"isms\" within the \"organizational constructor\" from Fig. 5 Unlike other \u0026ldquo;isms,\u0026rdquo; Vecheism does not assume predefined roles within any specific \u0026ldquo;ism\u0026rdquo; but is based on a family model of decision-making regarding collective hypotheses and implementation — beginning with what we strive for, \u0026ldquo;Ω — family.\u0026rdquo; It is founded on three principles:\nTruth (the pursuit of truth, primarily with oneself) Justice (the pursuit of justice, understanding that it may differ for everyone) Honor (the pursuit of \u0026ldquo;living by conscience,\u0026rdquo; to live according to one\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;soul,\u0026rdquo; without betraying it) In nature, everything is wisely thought out and arranged; everyone should do their own thing, and in this wisdom lies the highest justice of life. Leonardo da Vinci\nAgreements reached (\u0026ldquo;shaking hands\u0026rdquo;) at a veche (assembly) must be fulfilled, as in \u0026ldquo;a given word must be kept\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;standing by your word.\u0026rdquo;\nFamily:\nGod (the one \u0026ldquo;parents\u0026rdquo; listen to; a set of \u0026ldquo;principles and rules\u0026rdquo; — \u0026ldquo;do not kill, do not steal\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;)\n\u0026ldquo;Parent\u0026rdquo; - veto power (\u0026ldquo;parents do not interfere in children\u0026rsquo;s decisions but teach them to mature by warning against obvious mistakes based on their rich experience\u0026rdquo;) — 25% \u0026ldquo;profit\u0026rdquo; (e.g., \u0026ldquo;investors\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;founders of large projects\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; those who have much to offer/teach others — the \u0026ldquo;children\u0026rdquo;)\n\u0026ldquo;Older children\u0026rdquo; - 3 votes — 25% \u0026ldquo;profit\u0026rdquo; (e.g., \u0026ldquo;directors\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;top management\u0026rdquo;)\n\u0026ldquo;Middle children\u0026rdquo; - 3 votes — 25% \u0026ldquo;profit\u0026rdquo; (e.g., \u0026ldquo;employees\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;participants\u0026rdquo;)\n\u0026ldquo;Younger children\u0026rdquo; - 3 votes — 25% \u0026ldquo;profit\u0026rdquo; (e.g., \u0026ldquo;consumers\u0026rdquo;)\nVecheism is a method for selecting and testing \u0026ldquo;collective hypotheses\u0026rdquo; that can be implemented on blockchain. Importantly, when making decisions, feedback mechanisms are also established, which can be gathered through mobile devices, allowing quicker assessment of whether \u0026ldquo;progress is in the right direction.\u0026rdquo; The system will store experiences and interaction \u0026ldquo;templates\u0026rdquo; and suggest pre-made collaboration \u0026ldquo;templates\u0026rdquo; with the possibility of modification (as seen with Miro, Notion, DAO constructors, etc.). The results of collective work are distributed within the blockchain system (also used for voting, feedback, and more).\nIn the process of \u0026ldquo;growing,\u0026rdquo; a person can \u0026ldquo;mature\u0026rdquo; or become a \u0026ldquo;parent.\u0026rdquo; Existing companies (e.g., Sberbank, Gazprom) can be reformatted into \u0026ldquo;Vecheism\u0026rdquo; while retaining their current structure, but now everyone \u0026ldquo;benefits from the success of the family business\u0026hellip; including financially.\u0026rdquo; This can start with a small enterprise in one location, leading to conclusions and adaptations, and gradually tested in other contexts, considering the unique characteristics of each case.\nI have never met a person who didn't have something to teach. Alfred de Vigny\nVecheism — Our Proposal to the World If you desire it, you cannot separate your life from humanity. You live within it, by it, and for it. We are all made to cooperate, like feet, hands, and eyes. People exist for each other. Marcus Aurelius\nConsidering our people\u0026rsquo;s distaste for rigid disciplinary systems, Vecheism offers both flexibility and a foundation close to our hearts (justice — truth — honor). This is something we can \u0026ldquo;offer\u0026rdquo; the world as an alternative. Moreover, we are not limited to any specific structure and can take the best from everything already invented, while also creating new \u0026ldquo;isms\u0026rdquo; and testing them efficiently (perhaps starting small, adjusting, and scaling up — something that may have been missing in the USSR for the gradual implementation of changes).\nIt seems that our people value \u0026ldquo;substance\u0026rdquo; more than \u0026ldquo;form.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps this is why terms like PR, marketing, branding, and the like weren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;invented\u0026rdquo; in our culture but were imported. These concepts focus on \u0026ldquo;form,\u0026rdquo; an area where we lag behind other cultures. Perhaps we should \u0026ldquo;accept ourselves as we are\u0026rdquo;: why would we need something, even if it \u0026ldquo;sounds,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;smells,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;feels\u0026rdquo; good, if it lacks justice, truth, and honor? Maybe, to solve \u0026ldquo;collective cognitive tasks,\u0026rdquo; we should start with the foundation: justice — truth — honor, and select the \u0026ldquo;form\u0026rdquo; based on the situation, relying on \u0026ldquo;feedback and experience\u0026rdquo; from others.\nThe basis of Vecheism is an \u0026ldquo;organizational constructor\u0026rdquo; (based on blockchain) with fast feedback. Smart contracts reduce \u0026ldquo;bureaucracy,\u0026rdquo; outlining all \u0026ldquo;roles,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;legal nuances and templates,\u0026rdquo; allowing the creation of any organization (LLC, DAO, etc.) with just a few clicks and concluding contracts (using electronic signatures). Initial groundwork is already underway. The establishment of any form of interaction, modification, and more will be predefined and integrated into the legal system, significantly speeding up task resolution.\nFig. 7 A \"slider\" graph for \"isms\" Each \u0026ldquo;point on the slider\u0026rdquo; (Fig. 7) is an organization. The platform can suggest templates for interactions and more.\nFig. 8 Example of \"templates\" in Miro Fig. 9 Example of \"templates\" in Notion Fig. 10 Example of \"templates\" in Canva Fig. 11 55 \"templates\" in business models. Business model navigator () Templates, feedback, recommendations, \u0026ldquo;experience\u0026rdquo; in task-solving in different contexts, and more are shared among all participants. All code is Open Source, meaning others can \u0026ldquo;program\u0026rdquo; their own \u0026ldquo;organizations,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;hypotheses,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;..isms,\u0026rdquo; and more — this is collective work for the common good. All forms of interaction are checked for legality, as are all smart contracts. The organization\u0026rsquo;s activity reports can be open to the \u0026ldquo;widest possible audience,\u0026rdquo; depending on the context.\nIn every situation, something comforting can be found if you look for it. Daniel Defoe\nJustice Russia advocates for a multipolar world. Perhaps the word \u0026ldquo;justice\u0026rdquo; is intentionally left out (i.e., a \u0026ldquo;more just world\u0026rdquo;) so as not to accidentally look into the mirror and see an unflattering reflection.\nAs the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t take words out of a song,\u0026rdquo; and as we used to say in Mykolaiv:\nBefore you make claims, make sure you can back up your words. Also:\nYou must be accountable for your words: Perhaps we should strive for \u0026ldquo;no less justice\u0026rdquo; internally than \u0026ldquo;within\u0026rdquo; our opponents, not only in geopolitics.\nIt seems that \u0026ldquo;hot phases of confrontation\u0026rdquo; were not our weak point, but rather the \u0026ldquo;cold phases of struggle.\u0026rdquo; When the \u0026ldquo;hot phase\u0026rdquo; ends, if there is no striving for justice (whatever it may be called in form) \u0026ldquo;internally,\u0026rdquo; this will, in the long run, lead to an accumulation of internal contradictions with the risk of repeating our past mistakes. Personally, I felt ashamed when I still lived in Ukraine*, seeing how our pensioners and others lived.\n\\*on/in Ukraine: I say it \"the old-fashioned way,\" as we used to say \"in the yard and beyond\" in Mykolaiv. **According to newspeak v10.01, the correct way to say it is \u0026ldquo;in Ukraine\u0026rdquo;; I haven\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;retrained\u0026rdquo; myself yet; 1984.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t see \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; reasons why enterprises extracting natural resources should not share profits with all people in the \u0026ldquo;USSR.\u0026rdquo; Note, I\u0026rsquo;m not claiming I\u0026rsquo;m right, maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;perspective\u0026rdquo; (read: arguments) from which such a situation seems fair — in that case, it needs to be taken into account.\nIf the owners do not want to reformat their enterprises into a \u0026ldquo;family version or something similar\u0026rdquo; — that\u0026rsquo;s fine. Some people need to own \u0026ldquo;newspapers, factories, and steamships\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; it happens\u0026hellip; the main thing is that it passes\u0026hellip;, we can wait 11-111 years until they are gone — no one has taken anything with them yet. After that, various options can gradually be tested, if there is a demand.\nNonviolence\nTo be human is to feel that you are responsible for everything. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\nExamples. P: 25% — State E: 25% — Top Management M: 25% — Workers Y: 25% — Population of Russia P: 25% — Investor with no right of intervention, but with veto power\nE: 25% — Durov and/or Top Management\nM: 25% — Workers\nY1: 25% — Users who pay a monthly fee for usage; each according to their ability\nY0: 0% — Other users can use the platform for free, but they cannot participate in company life, vote for representatives, or engage in strategic discussions\nLife is a gift from the few to the many, from those who know and can do, to those who don’t know and cannot do. A. Modigliani\nAnthropotype and Justice To live means not only to satisfy the material demands of the body but primarily to be aware of one’s human unity. J. Verne\nWithout increasing justice, the accumulated internal contradictions are \u0026ldquo;suppressed\u0026rdquo; by redirecting attention and \u0026ldquo;righteous anger\u0026rdquo; towards a \u0026ldquo;common enemy,\u0026rdquo; whether internal, external, or hybrid. This is achieved by shaping an anthropotype of a person — a \u0026ldquo;dopamine addict\u0026rdquo; with a low level of critical thinking, ideally with a (cognitive) \u0026ldquo;trauma.\u0026rdquo; This is practiced to varying degrees by all states, with some achieving greater success (Ukraine, USA, Russia), and others less so (Switzerland).\nIt’s also \u0026ldquo;common\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;export\u0026rdquo; internal contradictions, tension, and problems abroad (for example, through financial-insurance systems, legislation) while \u0026ldquo;importing\u0026rdquo; resources (such as human capital, minerals).\n\u0026ldquo;Masculinity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;male aggression\u0026rdquo; are a \u0026ldquo;threat\u0026rdquo; to the \u0026ldquo;status quo\u0026rdquo; — the system, which is why the fostered anthropotype will be a \u0026ldquo;castrated man\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;feminized,\u0026rdquo; which will be \u0026ldquo;encouraged.\u0026rdquo;\nThere seem to be more worthy targets for righteous anger than \u0026ldquo;Jew against Palestinian,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Azerbaijani against Armenian,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Ukrainian against Russian,\u0026rdquo; and vice versa. For instance, slavery (we’ve broken the \u0026ldquo;historical record\u0026rdquo; for the number of slaves in the world), child and human trafficking, organ trafficking from children, pedophilia among the \u0026ldquo;elite,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;satanism\u0026rdquo; and/or misanthropy, and world hunger. When I was little, it was \u0026ldquo;Africa is starving,\u0026rdquo; at age 10 - \u0026ldquo;Africa is starving,\u0026rdquo; at 20 - \u0026ldquo;Africa is starving,\u0026rdquo; at 30 - \u0026ldquo;Africa is starving\u0026rdquo;; and now I’m 40, \u0026ldquo;Africa is still starving.\u0026rdquo;\nI know of few problems that cannot be solved in 40 years (!!!). If this problem hasn’t been solved (hunger in Africa), then it is beneficial to the beneficiaries of the existing world order (e.g., grain brokers from England \u0026hellip;; traders on exchanges in England, Switzerland \u0026hellip;; consumers of cheap resources from Africa, both minerals and human\u0026hellip;).\nEvery person, who is superior to others in intellect and moral qualities, is, without their will or desire, responsible for others. J. Verne\nForgiveness and Compassion Ivanov stole — imprison him, Petrov also — \u0026ldquo;execute,\u0026rdquo; Rabinovich embezzled — \u0026ldquo;bloodsuckers\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; It seems to me that if you took \u0026ldquo;10 people from the street,\u0026rdquo; perhaps they would \u0026ldquo;steal\u0026rdquo; just as much. The issue, then, lies in our mindset and values.\nSomeone loves \u0026ldquo;newspapers, factories, and steamships\u0026rdquo; (personally, I don\u0026rsquo;t need this, I give up \u0026ldquo;my share\u0026rdquo; to them)\u0026hellip; it happens, as long as it passes.\nUndoubtedly, people who have reached high positions, possessing \u0026ldquo;newspapers, factories, and steamships,\u0026rdquo; are extraordinary and talented in their own way. Perhaps we should gradually \u0026ldquo;reset the social contract,\u0026rdquo; release such a person if they have \u0026ldquo;repented and want to do something for the benefit of people,\u0026rdquo; and try to find an application for their talents (maybe they\u0026rsquo;re a talented schemer, and such skills are needed in foreign affairs or elsewhere). This way, they can continue to own \u0026ldquo;newspapers, factories, and steamships,\u0026rdquo; while society also benefits. It seems that if society openly offered this person 200 million instead of stealing 1 billion, and they applied their \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; talents where needed, everyone would benefit.\n_It seems to me we need more compassion and patience._ Everyone exclaims: where is the person who will save us? We need a person! Do not seek this person. They are right in front of you. This person is you, me, each of us! How to make yourself a true human? Nothing is more difficult if you don't know how to want it; nothing is easier — if you want it. A. Dumas — son\nPersonal The task of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to live according to the law within yourself that you are conscious of. Marcus Aurelius\nAlthough human life is priceless, we always act as if there is something more valuable. A. de Saint-Exupéry\n\"2+2=4\" If you value your life, remember that others value theirs just as much. Euripides\nMemorable videos: 5, 1, 2, 3, 4\nOur children are also our \"parents\" in certain contexts, perhaps even our greatest \"teachers\": there is much we can learn from them — for example, preschoolers from \"Ukraine,\" \"Russia,\" \"Israel,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Turkey,\" \"America,\" \"Greece,\" \"Armenia,\" \"Azerbaijan\"... would likely easily find \"common ground\" while playing, and after their schooling... Likewise, a boy from Africa, scoring his first goal, would not be any less joyful than an Oligarch buying a new yacht... I see the resolution of conflict as having less violence, less bloodshed. For some reason, it is considered \"bravery\" to beat or kill... Less violence, more humanity. O. Buzina\nType 2 Perspective Andrey (from Greek, \u0026ldquo;man\u0026rdquo;) sought meaning. Taking the ball of yarn from Baba Yaga, he risked his life and descended to the bottom of the sea to find the treasures he was searching for. The treasures were intact, although Andrey gained scars and prosthetics in the process of descending. He celebrated his discovery in the forest with the birds, trees, wind, and Earth\u0026hellip; The treasures were so beautiful that there were no words to describe them. He decided to share them in the best way he could. The treasures remained there, untouched—Andrey no longer needed them, as they are now always with him and no less valuable. The birds and others joined in celebrating the joy of his discovery.\nA fairy tale, perhaps a lie, yet within it lies a hint, a lesson for the good fellows.\n\u0026ldquo;I play the melody of my soul with my life — in protection of women and children\u0026rdquo;\nI Need Your Help I am bringing the outlined ideas to life, and if you can help with \u0026ldquo;forms,\u0026rdquo; advice, feedback, material resources, connections, ideas, and more, I welcome everything.
