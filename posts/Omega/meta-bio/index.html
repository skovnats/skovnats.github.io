<p><em>After reading this, the reader will have an understanding of:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>who they are dealing with</em></li>
<li><em>where I came from</em></li>
<li><em>what my values are</em></li>
<li><em>where I am going</em></li>
<li><em>if we are on the same path and for how long, if yes</em></li>

<i>Ω. There are meanings that are worth expressing.</i>
<p><em>I tried all the available answers in the literal and figurative sense of the word, which were offered to me from the outside (for example, by society, spiritual practices, science, cultures, religions, books, films, etc.), but none of the answers suited me&hellip; and I found it my way. The answer is not new. I hope the forms I’ve chosen will be understood. If not — feel free to ask, the contact details are below. When I talk about the answer, I mean the answer to the question &ldquo;What is all this for?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>In my coordinate system, Socrates was a spiritual practitioner. I also consider myself a spiritual practitioner&hellip; and still ignorant in some matters, and a fool. Anyone can be my teacher&hellip; I practice my method&hellip; similar to the &ldquo;Socratic method.&rdquo; I invent different practices for myself and those who come to me; tailored to the individual, the task, and the context.</em></p>
<p><em>In my articles, I will propose and explain how my approach to modeling reality works, and a new form of interaction; if there are questions — I will answer them. There will be 7 articles and/or lectures in total, not counting this introductory one. I have often received feedback that I am not much of a writer, to say the least, but I’m a good lecturer, so I will make video presentations for each article. Also, metaphorical stories will be woven into all the articles — it is easier for me to convey ideas and meanings this way.</em></p>
<p><em>In the paradigm I propose, many social and technological contradictions and conflicts are resolved. For example, the conflict between different social classes: investor, owner, worker, director, manager, employee, and client; weak AI in this paradigm becomes an assistant, not a threat or a replacement for humans; people gradually increase their level of awareness, and much more that is not obvious. Whether to apply this and in what form, everyone decides for themselves. I do not call for anything, but I offer.</em></p>
<p><em>Important:</em></p>
<p><em>everything I write is not the ultimate truth, but an invitation to discussion.</em></p>
<p><em>I think that the articles may be of interest to &ldquo;architects&rdquo; who invent &ldquo;games&rdquo; for themselves and others. Perhaps, it will be useful to think of me as an &ldquo;architect for architects.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>A bit of symbolism at the end. Ω — Omega, is the last letter of the Greek alphabet&hellip; the end, the summing up. I was born on the last day of all the zodiac signs, closing the horoscope year, and on the last day of the astronomical solar calendar year — March 20, 1984, which corresponds to the number 9 in numerology, the last number in the decimal system. In the year of the rat. I consider myself &ldquo;both fish and meat&rdquo; (&ldquo;fish&rdquo; transitioning into &ldquo;Aries&rdquo;). In the articles and video lectures, I also sum up and propose an image of the future, because any end is also the beginning of something new&hellip; Perhaps you’ve noticed that the world is changing, that we may be on the brink of an era. At the same time, my name carries the symbol of a beginning — Α, the first letter of my name and the Greek alphabet; my name originates from the Greek goddess Αρτεμισία, the goddess not only of the hunt, but also of the protection of children and conception, the beginning of new life.</em></p>

<h3 id="_part-1_"><strong><em>Part 1</em></strong></h3>
<p><strong>About the Soul.</strong> A person typically consists of subpersonalities that inhabit their metaphorical town. In my town, there is a professor. This title was given to him by the townspeople themselves — he is an unquestionable authority, always calm and impartial. A single gesture from him was enough to stop any conflict. He knew what to do&hellip; both in war and in famine. He appeared unnoticed when needed, and just as unnoticed, he disappeared when the war and famine ended&hellip; in June 2019. The address on his note — Crete. Perhaps, after completing the survival task, he went to rest and search for a meaning that is worth <em>expressing</em>. He and part of the town survived only thanks to him. <strong>But surviving&hellip; is that the most important thing&hellip; or?</strong></p>
<p><em>My answer: physical survival is meaningless if the soul is betrayed, it is the most valuable thing; the professor ensured the survival of the soul, even if it meant sacrificing many other residents of the conditional town and physical health.</em></p>
<p><em>Explanation: &ldquo;wars and famines&rdquo; stay with us inside for a long time after experiencing real catastrophes, sometimes — forever.</em></p>
<h3 id="_part-2_"><strong><em>Part 2</em></strong></h3>
<p><strong>About Survival.</strong> Our symbolic inner town is dual to external reality. There, too, are conflicts and even wars.</p>
<p>Wars can be different: hybrid, with obvious enemies or without. There are complex wars — when the enemy inside a person, due to ignorance, illness, or ill intent, brings internal war to others&hellip; it may even come in a beautiful package, with beautiful and correct words&hellip; you don’t immediately understand how you ended up with a war and famine&hellip; and inside as well. Internal war, if left unaddressed, can start a war in external reality. The source of internal enemies&hellip; a lack of love&hellip; for oneself&hellip;</p>
<p>There are conflicts whose price is survival. They can be with anyone, including internal enemies of one’s mother and other close ones. The hardest part is when such conflicts occur before you have formed, as a child, for example, and even harder if you depend on these &ldquo;opponents&rdquo; — it is especially difficult and you have to be without a mother&hellip; and without authorities. Even harder if, in addition, there is no one around to lean on. Sometimes this is not due to someone’s internal enemies; sometimes people freeze from fear, unable to move&hellip; and you have to be without a father. But everything can change in a second. You have to use whatever comes to hand, any opportunity, learn to achieve the desired result with minimal resources. Even harder when, on top of that, your mother fell ill, &ldquo;went mad,&rdquo; and controls everything&hellip; and the external environment has collapsed, famine&hellip;</p>
<p>In the survival war, it is important to minimize dependence on others — to plan strategies so that enemies cannot theoretically interfere with long-term tasks&hellip; internal enemies of relatives, first of all, in the context of the above. Complex wars also occur when internal enemies of parents are on different sides, tearing you apart. In war, you have to be constantly vigilant, watching and noticing the slightest changes, habits, speech patterns, deviations from the &ldquo;standard&rdquo;-&ldquo;template&rdquo;&hellip; be able to quickly assess the situation.</p>
<p>The model of my mother is probably the first model I built. Then my father’s. I learned to model people’s characters, identify certain properties, even by appearance. Because with models there is predictability. People are predictable if you’ve been with them in war and famine, and they’ve overcome their internal enemies (cowardice, arrogance, etc.). <strong>Sometimes it’s a pity when there’s no war and famine; it’s much easier to understand people&hellip; otherwise it’s hard.</strong></p>
<p><em>Explanation: unresolved internal problems of a person usually affect them and others. Under difficult external circumstances, internal problems are exacerbated: if the &ldquo;roof of the house&rdquo; is poorly secured, but the weather is clear, it will hold up, and you won’t immediately know there’s a problem. They become apparent when there’s a &ldquo;hurricane.&rdquo; In my experience, a person reveals themselves in &ldquo;times of hurricanes&rdquo; or power, often unexpectedly for the person themselves. In normal times, a person uses masks, maybe very &ldquo;thick&rdquo; and &ldquo;quality&rdquo; ones. Since I lived in extreme survival conditions for many years, it is important for me to understand who I am with, whether I can rely on this person in any situation, including &ldquo;war.&rdquo; It is very difficult, maybe even impossible to say, if a person has not at least once been in an extreme situation&hellip; that is why it is difficult to understand people, &ldquo;when there’s no war and famine.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h3 id="_part-3_"><strong><em>Part 3</em></strong></h3>
<p><strong>About the Bunker.</strong> The purpose of the bunker is survival and preservation in an extremely unpredictable, contradictory, and hostile environment. Survival of the soul is the priority.</p>
<p>The existence of the bunker was a secret. It was probably built by a child, but it feels like it was under someone&rsquo;s guidance. It was &ldquo;underground&rdquo; and absolutely invisible. It let almost nothing in from the outside without filtration and thorough preliminary analysis: neither &ldquo;air,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;water,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;information,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;shouts,&rdquo; nor laws/norms/orders/traditions/fashion&hellip; nor words/values/emotions from the mother, father&hellip; nor anyone or anything else. 1 lived there. Many other residents of the town&hellip; many&hellip; did not survive or were severely injured by frequent <em>almost</em> unpredictable emissions of poison, filth, and vinegar into the &ldquo;soil,&rdquo; &ldquo;water,&rdquo; and &ldquo;air&rdquo;&hellip; as well as from clashes in various types of wars. All these corpses were stored in the &ldquo;manor house,&rdquo; which was intended for 1&hellip; this was the easiest way to dispose of the bodies. It was difficult for 1 to befriend anyone in the &ldquo;town&rdquo; or make contact since they were the main target&hellip; people and animals close to them were immediately in danger&hellip; as was the case with his beloved dog, which he even started bringing into the bunker&hellip; it was killed&hellip; after that, he didn’t make such mistakes — no more getting close. &ldquo;Poison,&rdquo; &ldquo;toxins,&rdquo; &ldquo;filth&rdquo; formed a large lake over the years. The &ldquo;well,&rdquo; which used to contain the &ldquo;purest water,&rdquo; over the years filled to the brim with filth, feces, urine, etc., due to runoff from the bunker and other external sources. In 2019, 1 purified all the filth, drank it and digested it, also removing all the stench and corpses. The peak came in July 2020 — the bunker was opened&hellip; to clean everything inside and establish contact. The entire village, the lake, the well, and the house are ready for settlement and interaction.</p>
<h3 id="_part-4_"><strong><em>Part 4</em></strong></h3>
<p><strong>About People.</strong> People are different — sometimes a person has so many internal enemies that it is a pity&hellip; they are always with him and he sees their shadows in others.</p>
<p>Observations.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a shark taken out of the water is harmless and dies immediately. The environment is crucial.</p>
<p>A tough and experienced mechanic named Kolya turned into a 3-to-5-year-old helpless child with a trembling body from fear — Sanya, the captain of our small fishing vessel, yelled at him. Afghanistan — captivity. Unresolved past traumas heavily influence future life.</p>
<p>Kolya — a homeless man in &ldquo;Shokoladnitsa&rdquo; in the center of Moscow told me about his childhood — I understood that he was not loved, there was no one to believe in and support him during his childhood, even though he was kind — he took leftover food to his homeless friends even though no one was nearby. People from our surroundings shape us, and it&rsquo;s important that at the &ldquo;right&rdquo; moment, someone supports us.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s useful to crawl — I crawled out of a circle of 8 people and &ldquo;Hey kid, got a light?&rdquo; but Denis didn’t. I ran to the exit — freedom, but my friend was already on the ground, surrounded. &ldquo;Russians don&rsquo;t leave their own&rdquo; — I had to stay&hellip; Then there were two boxer friends. It turns out not everyone can look the crowd in the eyes and &ldquo;stay.&rdquo; But you shouldn&rsquo;t blame&hellip; forgiveness is important&hellip; of yourself too if necessary.</p>
<p>The children in Palestine ran after our buses. From the window, it seemed they lived in the &ldquo;5th century AD.&rdquo; Maybe they even thought that way&hellip; they looked happy.</p>
<p>A laborer in Palestine — it’s sad, you’re in your underwear with a brigade in someone’s house for the night, and the former owners come to collect their belongings&hellip; their previous life is behind them. This was familiar to me, I too had left my past behind&hellip; but often it stays inside, only later does it manifest outside.</p>
<p>A pickpocket-thief, who had served time, &ldquo;touring&rdquo; Moscow, passed &ldquo;interviews&rdquo; with a gang, with whom we became friends, remains in memory — interesting, would he have become a thief if the USSR hadn&rsquo;t collapsed, but he was talented, gifted by God to speak with people.</p>
<p>Many criticize the past, the USSR, but everything good that happened in my life came from the USSR. I watched from the bunker as the &ldquo;hurricanes,&rdquo; starting with the collapse of the country and the formation of a new one, carried away an uncountable number of &ldquo;roofs of houses&rdquo;: drug addicts, maniacs, perverts, violence, the chase after shiny trinkets, racketeering, thefts, privatization, impoverishment, and much, much more. A guy I crossed paths with in boxing, and during one conflict, killed an old woman for 50 kopecks by jumping on her with friends. Yet, in boxing, he was quieter than water and lower than grass, but in my school, he was the &ldquo;main bandit&rdquo; — people manifest differently in different contexts.</p>
<p>Interestingly, academic articles contain lies, and it is done deliberately, particularly to &ldquo;survive&rdquo; in the race for citations and publications.</p>
<p>An old professor in the &ldquo;father&rsquo;s&rdquo; office asked, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of this article? Where was &lsquo;father&rsquo; looking?&rdquo;; I was confused and ashamed, and the article was written in a week&hellip; I barely had time to get the results&hellip; &ldquo;father&rdquo; wrote the entire text, pressured me, told me what to do&hellip; and at the end, 10 minutes before the article submission deadline, he directly said &ldquo;falsify the results&rdquo;&hellip; I did everything I could to avoid shame&hellip; I even outright refused to include it in my doctorate&hellip; although &ldquo;father&rdquo; pressured me. Now I have no trust in all these big journals, universities, and professors.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t blame &ldquo;father,&rdquo; he plays by the system’s rules&hellip; there are much worse cases. Like my friend Dima&rsquo;s: they conduct research on cancer patients, and there &ldquo;inaccuracies&rdquo; play a &ldquo;slightly&rdquo; different role and consequences.</p>
<p>It seems they enjoy this game of numbers and prestige. In business, it&rsquo;s more honest — there’s at least a &ldquo;need&rdquo; criterion, though not always. <strong>But power/money/prestige&hellip; is that the most important thing&hellip; or?</strong></p>
<p><em>My answer: I love science and for me, above all: truth - freedom - love. Power is a strong drug, and money is just a tool. My grandfather used to say that of all the inventions of humanity, money is closest to the Devil. I agree, though I’m not sure it&rsquo;s the closest. In general, money is a big test. Also, it seems to me that we, people who were given a &ldquo;clear head&rdquo; and the trust/money from society to conduct research, have a moral responsibility to make everyone’s life better.</em></p>
<p><em>Explanation: from the bunker, it is clearly visible how the environment shapes a person — how we learn, what value means, what is good and bad&hellip; how we should act&hellip; think&hellip; feel&hellip; and then we don’t even realize why we feel a certain way in a particular situation. For &ldquo;99.99999%&rdquo; of people, it’s enough to create the environment-conditions&hellip; they will absorb everything themselves and will do what is &ldquo;needed.&rdquo; This is clearly illustrated in the &ldquo;Matrix&rdquo; trilogy in the context of a science fiction scenario, which, in my observations, &ldquo;well&rdquo; describes the real state of affairs. Naturally, by &ldquo;father&rdquo; I mean my academic mentor.</em></p>
<h3 id="_part-5_"><strong><em>Part 5</em></strong></h3>
<p><strong>About the Core.</strong> Faith comes in many forms — my great-grandmother was devout, often crossing herself, reading the &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo; prayer and other prayers. She told me as much as she could about faith and about Jesus. She was strict, but predictable.</p>
<p>It’s a pity I didn’t live with her all the time; I felt good with her, better than with my mom and dad: when war and famine occurred, their internal enemies took over, and it was extremely tough.</p>
<p>She instilled something very deep&hellip; and the image of Jesus. This deepness became the foundation upon which the bunker was built. The image of Jesus remained somewhere very high&hellip; a star in the sky, a guiding star. But since I was stubborn and didn’t believe in anything or anyone, I denied the existence of God&hellip; until the moment the bunker was opened.</p>
<p>Later, I learned about other stars. It seems we rarely look up at our guiding stars anymore, and more and more to the sides&hellip; at the neighbor, at phones, social networks, news, trinkets, money, etc.</p>
<p>But I know that &ldquo;this&rdquo; during &ldquo;war and famine&rdquo; is unimportant. A relative or just a decent person, clean air, water, food, peace, and nature&hellip; those things are important. <strong>Sometimes it’s a pity when there’s no war and famine; it’s much easier to understand values&hellip; otherwise, it’s hard.</strong></p>
<p><em>Explanation: human psychology is usually structured like an onion, with a certain core inside. The masks/peels fall off under pressure, as I wrote in Part 2. Having been without water, food, peace, shelter, silence, sleep, or a close person, you understand what is truly valuable.</em></p>
<h3 id="_part-6_"><strong><em>Part 6</em></strong></h3>
<p><strong>About Values.</strong> Gratitude comes in many forms <em>—</em> sometimes you stand up for someone against the crowd, but then they switch sides, and now you’re in their place. His weakness and cowardice&hellip; it happens&hellip; the main thing is for it to pass.</p>
<p>In situations where I couldn&rsquo;t cope psychologically, I used &ldquo;forgetting.&rdquo; I forgot so many things. True, I used to suffer from terrible headaches. But you choose the lesser of two evils&hellip; I guess.</p>
<p>I stopped exposing myself to harm by helping <em>—</em> I learned; now I help when I can&hellip; although I almost always overestimate my strength, but I’ve devised a system — I help at 80% of what I think I can do or offer. After that, if I can do more — I multiply by 80% again and so on. It works.</p>
<p>When I was 14, I was paid 14 hryvnias for an entire night unloading grain from a truck with a trailer, possibly 20-25 tons (I was with a group). Ice cream was the only thing I kept for myself; the rest I gave to my parents&hellip; hunger.</p>
<p>I was the best speaker, a builder, a shark catcher, I helped the Estonian government with cadastral land data analysis, worked with children — even received an award, worked on plantations for Koreans for onions, DJing at discos, assistant boxing coach in Israel at university, and much more.</p>
<p>I stopped working with Estonia when I realized that as a result, my model would lead to a significant increase in payments to the Estonian government by all residents, and this was during a financial crisis (&ldquo;corona&rdquo;). Even though I had no other job, I refused.</p>
<p>I love Russian films and my native Russian culture in general, Greek songs and culture, Ukrainian culture, and much more. I take what I like from everyone, and I learn&hellip; I learn from everything&hellip; including my beloved cat Murka-Alice and from children.</p>
<p>I love helping others, finding win-win solutions so that everyone benefits&hellip; fortunately, my experience allows me to find common ground with any person, regardless of their social status, cultural background, or level of adequacy.</p>
<p>I value everything natural, living, and am calm about social games, conditions, and things.</p>
<p>I know what it means to starve&hellip;</p>
<p>I saw the country I was born in collapse — the S/USSR, and what it’s like to go through all that as a child&hellip; how people lose their minds, how their support crumbles&hellip; the psyche can’t handle it, hunger, maniacs, crime, drugs, ideology, looting of factories and everything within reach, exhausting work for pennies, poverty, constant changes in history, rules, and much more.</p>
<p>When I grew up and lived in many places, figuring out how socio-economic systems work and how the &ldquo;influential uncles&rdquo; play their games, the results of which become wars, revolutions, and much more&hellip; as I became an adult uncle&hellip; <strong>I don’t want anyone to go through what I did because of their games</strong>&hellip; no child should suffer from adult games, and I don’t care what territory it happens in. If the &ldquo;uncles&rdquo; want to, I’ll devise a game for them to play without involving the innocent, I have no problem with how adults consciously handle their lives. I’ve practiced quite extreme practices and it’s unlikely that I can be surprised by anything.</p>
<p>I am categorically against collapse and revolutions&hellip; especially in Russia, under the noble pretexts of democracy, justice, etc. I am also against puppet politicians anywhere.</p>
<h3 id="_part-7_"><strong><em>Part 7</em></strong></h3>
<p><strong>About the Path.</strong> From the bunker, I looked far and deep&hellip; as much as I could, but maybe my reader wants to look further and deeper, great! Reach out if you have questions, I’ll help as much as I can <em>—</em> but now I want to play a little with others&hellip; with social symbols&hellip; anthems&hellip; flags&hellip; money&hellip; statuses and other games we take so seriously. It’s interesting how money is such an important toy for us&hellip; but &ldquo;nobody knows what money is&rdquo; (c)&hellip; <a href="https://t.me/finfak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanya</a>, not just money&hellip; we can’t define anything&hellip; there will always be a follow-up question-clarification/special case&hellip; it’s impossible to ask the &ldquo;final question&rdquo; (hello Socrates!). The basis is faith.</p>
<p>Absolute evil exists. These entities &ldquo;feed&rdquo; on the energy of innocent souls, primarily children. There are people more competent than me in such matters. I’ve reached the level of understanding that’s sufficient for me to act in my earthly life.</p>
<p><strong>I challenge evil — darkness:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>first of all</strong> the evil, darkness, and ignorance <strong>inside me</strong>, which entered through my weaknesses, ignorance, laziness, fear&hellip;</li>
<li>as I &ldquo;illuminate inside myself&rdquo; my inner space, and as additional resources (psychological-emotional-physical-material-social and others) appear, I will direct everything I can toward the &ldquo;light&rdquo; and outside&hellip; if God allows, I will reach the darkest places that exist in a person&rsquo;s soul and its material manifestation&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not satisfied with the fact that there are places where defenseless, needy people suffer in our time. I think humanity can come up with something better — how we all can live together and get along. With anyone who is willing to negotiate (even pedophiles who do not want to involve children in their fantasies and psychological deviations, even fraudsters, anyone&hellip;): I am ready to speak openly and find common ground, devising a mutually beneficial coexistence format.</p>
<p>The criteria for whom I’m willing to negotiate with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a person tries to follow God’s commandments (the confession doesn’t matter); if non-believer:</li>
<li>values: truth-freedom-love and/or a &ldquo;Creator&rdquo; person, creation</li>
<li>a principle of non-violence against another being</li>
</ul>
<p>We must understand who the &ldquo;opponent&rdquo; is: some people <em>consciously</em> serve &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; and devote all their strength to this service. There are people 100 times smarter than me, more influential, enduring, insightful, cunning, who know and use people&rsquo;s ignorance for their purposes, mimicking &ldquo;light&rdquo; and much more&hellip; They act together, trying to divide us, guided by the principle: &ldquo;divide and rule&rdquo; (c). Some of them perform open rituals of worship to &ldquo;darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those uncomfortable with &ldquo;religious&rdquo; rhetoric, I can translate everything into &ldquo;secular language,&rdquo; feel free to ask.</p>
<p><strong>My Path. Building &ldquo;Bridges&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>Bridges come in different forms. For example, bridges between 1 (who came out of the &ldquo;bunker&rdquo;) and people. Also, bridges may be needed within a person between conflicting parts of themselves; or even to &ldquo;build a bridge&rdquo; to a part of a person they didn&rsquo;t know existed. Finally, bridges may be needed between groups of people.</p>
<p>I look with a horizon of 10-25 years and further ahead. Current politicians, the &ldquo;big uncles,&rdquo; will &ldquo;finish playing,&rdquo; but we and our children will continue to live, negotiate, and solve problems together&hellip; if nothing changes, many will hate each other. My goal is to build a platform-&ldquo;bridge&rdquo; so that people can implement any existing form of interaction in just a few mouse clicks, but more importantly, so they can quickly change the forms of interaction considering the feedback from &ldquo;reality,&rdquo; and try new collaboration formats to solve old and new problems.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the key to our prosperity and survival, ultimately, is our ability to negotiate, to find mutually beneficial forms of cooperation. Transparently, predictably, and clearly, with the ability to quickly make decisions and adapt to changes. With those willing to negotiate, and for those who aren’t but are aggressive, we must unite and fight if attacked.</p>
<p>To be able to negotiate, you first need to know <strong>yourself</strong>: who are you and why are you here? How can you know what to ask of another if you don’t know what <strong>YOU</strong> want? Maybe your desire was imposed on you by advertising, fashion, &ldquo;cool guys from the block&rdquo;&hellip; Therefore, real change is only possible by increasing your level of <strong>awareness</strong>, <strong>knowledge</strong>&hellip; primarily about yourself.</p>
<p>The path does not imply that I will tell anyone how to live, but awakening the &ldquo;A,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Creator&rdquo; in each person, helping each one emerge from ignorance (teach me something too) and realize their full potential in this life. If someone needs yachts and islands for this, then we need to cooperate and I will help jointly earn it&hellip; the main thing is not to place too much value on the material&hellip; although you can if you like — it’s your life.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong> Practicing extreme practice &ldquo;conscious madness&rdquo; in July 2020, I understood and came up with certain things. My goal is to share these ideas through my native Russian culture in the hope that it will help someone live &ldquo;their own life&rdquo; and that &ldquo;we together will leave behind everything no worse than we inherited it from our ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Metaphorically, I position myself as the &ldquo;old rat Master Splinter&rdquo;&hellip; from Ninja Turtles :-)&hellip; for various reasons, I don’t have much health left, and I don’t know how much longer I can be of use, but I have experience, wisdom&hellip; and kindness.</p>
<p>Regarding nationalism:</p>
<p>Ideally, we are one big family, and we have one common home, our Earth. I see Russian culture as a kind of metaphorical bridge between all other cultures for mutually beneficial finding of common language, in both literal and figurative senses&hellip; for business and technology, we can use simpler English, for example&hellip; maybe Russian culture can also build a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; between China and the &ldquo;East&rdquo; and the West, so that we all find common ground without resorting to our old scheme: world war number N&hellip; we’ll see.</p>
