<h3 id="from-the-author"><strong>From the Author</strong></h3>
<p>This training article is intentionally written in a “ragged tempo,” with numerous open questions, a great many explicit and hidden meanings and interconnections, and sharp transitions. I assume it’s possible to “get lost” from meaning overload. After overload and a rest, try again. Those with experience working with koans might approach this piece precisely as a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%B0%D0%BD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">koan</a>, and reading it as working with a koan. If you have questions, my contacts are at the bottom.</p>

<p>Obviously, AI has “arrived,” at least AI models have. <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Age of AI Has Begun, as Bill Gates argued</a> in his 03/2023 piece, where he describes his vision and expresses hopes of solving humanity’s old and new problems with “new tools.” There’s no shortage of articles and other materials on the topic. Since I work in the field and have my own view, I wrote part of this article in 03–05/2023. For personal reasons, I’m finishing and publishing it only now. Beyond AI, the article raises what seems to me the main question, which I’ll develop in subsequent publications. I also talk about “future scenarios,” so I think that 10–12 months after writing, it’ll be clearer whether my reflections were mistaken.</p>

<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>All my articles are numbered and the index number matters. My pieces raise philosophical–practical questions and are meant for thoughtful, unhurried reading. The goal is to increase awareness, to prompt reflection: I likely raise questions more than I answer them. The article <a href="#meta-bio">“#0: A Metaphorical Autobiography, or the Professor’s Bunker Stories”</a> is the intro, about the author.</p>
<h3 id="why-im-writing-this-and-why-now"><strong>Why I’m writing this and why now</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
I wanted to express my thoughts this way, and I hope it’s interesting and/or useful to someone.
</blockquote>
<p>Millions of laypeople and “been-around” folks have been impressed by AI models for years now, with growing amazement and anticipation (some perhaps with caution) as they await the next versions of well-known AI products. Many competent and/or famous people urgently proposed a <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6-month pause</a> in AI development.</p>
<p>Some colleagues in the “trade” offer their own view of how the results of their and our collective work affect society (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI’s article</a>). A Facebook post by an experienced data engineer sharing impressions of that article caught my attention.</p>
<p>He was extremely surprised by how things are unfolding and recalled his 2015 taxi conversation in Tbilisi, asking the driver what he would do when <strong>soon</strong> cars drive themselves. What surprised him was that AI tech would first affect high-paid jobs.</p>
<p>I find it ironic and worthy of deeper awareness that large numbers of smart, well-paid people worldwide are working on something whose consequences they themselves don’t understand. Into this context neatly fits the notorious <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-22/openai-board-dispute-with-sam-altman-shows-governance-flaws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI scandal</a> firing CEO Sam Altman and his return: it’s ironic that people who can’t calculate the consequences of their own decisions within a single company set out to “make the world better by creating strong AI.” It’s also apt to recall Elon Musk’s “disavowal” of his “brainchild” and the ironic becoming of <strong>Open</strong>AI not all that “<strong>Open</strong>.” This is a huge contrast with the past: the cobbler knew that if he invested time and energy he’d make shoes, etc. One could compare our activity to experimental scientists, but then the scale of resources invested (money, people, etc.) is enormous compared to lone scientists/groups of the past, given that we don’t grasp the consequences of the end product. That’s what I want to emphasize here. I also want to raise the question I consider the most important.</p>

<p>Through metaphors I’ll present a simple mental model you can use to model socio-economic dynamics.</p>
<h4 id="for-whom-im-writing"><strong>For whom I’m writing</strong></h4>
<p>I think my articles may interest “architects,” people who operate meta-mental (and more complex) models. Also, perhaps, people not used to employing <strong>different</strong> mental models to parse ongoing processes.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’ll learn another way to think about reality. Accordingly, you may see other causal links.</p>
<h4 id="about-the-author"><strong>About the author</strong></h4>
<p>I’ll share a few facts that shaped my mental models.</p>
<p><strong>Basis:</strong> roughly speaking, every “3 months to half-year I moved and adapted to another society/country” (first unconsciously, then consciously). For me it’s not a given: health, clean air, water, food, electricity, a place to sleep (sleep in silence is extra), a quiet place to be alone, peace, loved ones; clothing, etc. — those are already extras. I’ve worn many social roles. I’ve practiced various spiritual practices. I’ve interacted with people from different social strata. I’m also a mathematician and have loved numbers since childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Places lived</strong> (more than 2 months): <strong>Ukrainian SSR</strong>: Mykolaiv, Komsomolsk-on-Dnieper, Beryslav; <strong>Ukraine</strong>: Mykolaiv, Kramatorsk, Komsomolsk-on-Dnieper, Beryslav; <strong>Israel</strong>: Kibbutz Yagur, Nesher, Haifa; <strong>Switzerland</strong>: Lugano; <strong>France</strong>: Rennes; <strong>Greece</strong>: Athens; <strong>Germany</strong>: Berlin.

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 2. You are the captain, and this is your Metaphorical Ship</figcaption>
</figure><br>
<p>The ship-control metaphor is close to me because I had a small experience piloting a fishing vessel in the Mediterranean. I’ll extend that metaphor in the context of governing/modeling society/socio-economic systems. Imagine all humanity sailing on a ship. There are two helmsmen: the Collective Conscious and the Collective Unconscious. But that’s less interesting: imagine that you, my reader, are also the captain — of <em>your own vessel</em> (Fig. 2), which in some way affects the voyage of the large ship in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>Let’s first outline the laws and rules of motion. For easier memorization the laws are phrased simply. I formulated them for myself over a lifetime, and they reflect my <em>personal experience, knowledge, and observations</em>. Please use anything I “teach” reasonably and for good.</p>
<p>I hope it was interesting, reader, to spend a bit of your precious life with “me” reading this piece.</p>

  2. The “Matrix” Law, or “Oblomov-lite”

<i>
We often think and therefore act “automatically,” “by template,” executing certain “scripts.” Like a car, we can automatically switch among various, possibly very complex “scripts”/“templates” to solve familiar tasks without realizing it.
<p><em>Any action or thought beyond existing experience typically triggers anxiety and doubt and takes more effort than the familiar. This requires discipline and a certain habit not everyone has developed.</em></p>
<p><em>Mindfulness is a tool for overcoming “automation” and “programming” (a bit about mindfulness</em> <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>here</em></a><em>, and free training</em> <a href="http://meditation.college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>here</em></a><em>).</em></p>

</details><br>
<p>So people are in some measure “predictable,” “automated,” and being <em>mindful</em> breaks this Matrix Law. Mindfulness is “trending”: many meditate, do yoga, various <a href="https://www.retreatmanasa.ru/onlineretreat/fall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trainings</a>, <a href="https://www.knigi-online.net/nauchno-obrazovatelnaya/psihologiya/165-podsoznanie-mozhet-vse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">books</a>, go to psychologists (countless), etc. So this law isn’t a law and hardly works?</p>

  <summary><b>
  3. The “Echo in the Mountains” Law
  </b></summary>
<i>
It’s a mistake to think of mindfulness as a “point” action — “being in the moment” — because mindfulness has a “shape,” a “radius.” The “radius of mindfulness” can be “defined” as the “distance over which we hear the echoes of our actions, of ‘ourselves’… and, in a more advanced sense, of our thoughts”: like hearing your voice echo in the mountains; some are deaf, some hear a couple of echoes, some perhaps hear very long “reflections” from the cliffs.
<p>Alternatively, the “radius of mindfulness” is how deeply we grasp causes and effects and ourselves/our influence in this space in each moment and in different contexts.
</i></p>
</details><br>
<p>Got it: what many “train,” where “they go” in practice, is often mistaken and lets them “with a clear conscience” do what they would have done anyway. But what about practices — aren’t they supposed to help people understand this and more?</p>
<details id=law4>
  <summary><b>
  4. The “Controlled Opposition/Right-Wing” Law
  </b></summary>
<i>
<p>Any practice (e.g., <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/ru/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vipassana</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD3QwerSmLs&amp;ab_channel=WimHof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wim Hof breathing</a>, <a href="https://retreat.tb.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">silence retreats</a>, <a href="https://vk.com/satorynn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">satori</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l94nm_ECMWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reality testing</a>, psychoanalysis of various schools, <a href="https://dzen.ru/a/W9FstDLKFQCqxgaD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with koans</a>, pills/mushrooms/herbs, kinds of yoga, therapies, etc.) is a tool. Sometimes a very powerful one.</p>
<p>Every tool is created to solve certain tasks. Many practices/tools imply preserving the “status quo” while practicing them; that is, they’re designed specifically so certain things don’t change — first and foremost in the practitioner’s thinking.</p>
<p>People from “structures,” sabotage units, political technologists, etc., may find this easier to grasp: to control those who disagree with any system (and there will always be such people by the “Shooting Stick” law (existence confirmation) and the “Bell Curve” law (quantifies such people)), it’s more profitable to “lead” these movements, control the top; finance, watch, and control all their actions: protests, Telegram channels, etc.</p>
</i>
</details><br>
<p>So one way to preserve the “status quo,” especially in thinking, is to promote and encourage “convenient practices, meditations, notions of mindfulness, yoga…”? What other techniques are used?</p>

    5. The “Girl in the Red Dress” Law
  </b></summary>
<i>
<p>Those with children know you can redirect their attention so they “switch” from the “undesirable.” It’s similar with us: an “agenda” is created so we don’t pay attention to what we “shouldn’t”; as a result, the “wrong” questions and actions won’t come to mind.</p>

    7. The “Attention” Law

<i>
<p>Where your attention is, there are you.</p>
<p>We mistakenly think money, time, etc., are the main resource. The most important human resource is likely attention (here I should pivot to “soul” — the basis of everything — but I’ll stay in secular rhetoric). Next is energy. That’s why “influencers” and the like make money. Where people’s attention clusters, their energy is, which, in certain contexts, converts into money, for example.</p>
<p>This is probably the second most important law.</p>

    8. The “Pink Elephant” Law
  </b></summary>
<i>

<p>If someone has never heard or seen “pink elephants,” they can’t request a “pink elephant” for their “army.”</p>

<p>Even if you “see an iceberg ahead,” there is “inertia” that prevents an instant “stop.” Inertia exists both in a single person (e.g., a longtime heavy smoker usually can’t quit instantly… or instantly adopt a new habit — “change their ship’s course”) and in a large socio-economic system.</p>

    13. The “Prophet” Law or “Disruptive Innovation”
  </b></summary>
<i>
<p>If you do something that changes the system (primarily people’s thinking or you shift attention to what “shouldn’t be”), you start having “problems.” The “problems” grow with the “threat level to the system” (e.g., cancellation, discrediting, intimidation of you and/or your loved ones, depriving you of your livelihood, “strange coincidences,” death, and anything else “opponents/beneficiaries of the system” can imagine).</p>
<p>Conversely, if you’re “awarded” for your activity, as a rule, at minimum you aren’t hindering “the system.” So the so-called “disruptive innovation” is largely a cultivated “illusion,” something that makes the system more resilient and gives it “antifragility” (re: “<a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%85%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antifragility</a>” — I’m not vouching; needs deeper thought).

<p>Laws can and should be combined.</p>
<h3 id="the-journey-begins"><strong>The journey begins</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s inspect our ship in <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>
<p>We have a very large multi-deck ship. Some work in the “engine room” or kitchen, others ensure electronics run smoothly, someone parties carefree on the deck, etc.; there are many rooms.</p>
<p>We know some of the ship’s previous routes (note the info is incomplete and you should correct the “course” — the model — when new inputs arrive). Examples of “routes”: stories of different situations/civilizations, wars, discoveries, relationships, statistics of different strata in different contexts (e.g., expected number of breakdowns among assault/defense troops in a given situation with given ammo and inputs), etc.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="#law1">1. The Law of “Simplification”</a> and <a href="#law17">17. The “80/20” Law</a> there’s a limited number of “parameters” explaining “our ship’s route.” Additionally, from <a href="#law14">14. The “People Don’t Change” Law</a> it follows that if these “parameters” are closer to the “center,” they change much more slowly than the “external.” Finally, from <a href="#law12">12. The “Titanic” Law</a> it follows that “movement along the route” is highly inertial. What “center-close parameters” largely determine our “collective journey”?</p>
<p>It seems to me they are our <em>values</em> and <em>meanings</em>. That is, <strong><em>values</em></strong> and <strong><em>meanings</em></strong>, both <em>declared</em> and <em>real</em>, are indicators and beacons of our “movement toward various islands.” By “islands” I mean where we “end up” as a result of “our sailing”; we may linger on some, and avoid others if “coming closer” we see an “unpleasant island” — if we manage to “swerve,” per <a href="#law12">12. The “Titanic” Law</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of <em>values</em> or <em>meanings</em> (often the division is fuzzy):</p>
<ul>
<li>cost optimization, profit, ROI&hellip;</li>
<li>money: dollars, euros, rubles; crypto&hellip;</li>
<li>luxury: yachts, watches, brands, gold, diamonds&hellip;</li>
<li>success:</li>
<li>social reward: titles, certificates, followers, authorship of books/articles, co-authorship with famous people&hellip; tangible signs: car brand, address, a beautiful woman, a mistress&hellip;</li>
<li>health</li>
<li>avoidance: pain, shame, fears, humiliation&hellip;</li>
<li>striving: to enjoy&hellip;</li>
<li>resources: electricity, gas, oil&hellip;; food, water&hellip;</li>
<li>being on trend, first</li>
<li>being popular</li>
<li>feeling part of something bigger</li>
<li>owning “exclusive”: intellect, talent, clothing style, looks, diamonds, art&hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>In today’s ocean journey we’ll meet only 2 types of islands: islands of “<strong>1+1=2</strong>” and islands of “<strong>1+1&gt;2</strong>.”</p>
<h3 id="vm-motion-valuemeaning-motion"><strong>V&amp;M motion: Value–Meaning motion</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Definition 1.</strong> The considered parameters that determine society’s development dynamics — “the movement of our ship from <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>.”</p>
<p>“<strong>1+1=2</strong>” islands: events/things along our V&amp;M-course already marked on the “charts” with a high probability of encountering them on the island.</p>
<p>A few examples I’ve found on “<strong>1+1=2</strong>” islands: drones, Tesla, Starlink, deep learning, geometric deep learning, Transformers, Large Language Models, ChatGPT 1–4, Google, etc.</p>
<p>“<strong>1+1&gt;2</strong>” islands: unexpectedly encountered — non-obvious events/processes that radically change life aboard.</p>
<p>On “<strong>1+1&gt;2</strong>” islands I’ve seen electricity, the steam engine, nuclear energy, the internet, blockchain, possibly the smartphone, etc.</p>
<h3 id="a-mini-vm-cruise-toward-the-power-and-influence-islands"><strong>A mini V&amp;M cruise toward the “Power and Influence” islands</strong></h3>
<p>The value of power and influence is shared by many people on different continents. Often in practice, though not in words, these values outweigh the value of other human lives, etc. As long as this holds, there are wars and violence, resource grabs and values, not to mention psychological satisfaction from the process and result (read — I/we are cooler, stronger, smarter, richer, more democratic than everyone, etc.). The value of achieving goals with minimal resources is also widespread — meaning people will keep improving at it.</p>
<p>The above has held for a long time — it’s logical to assume we’ll continue to encounter along our V&amp;M movement “<strong>1+1=2</strong>” islands with manifestations of the attributes above. On this V&amp;M path among “<strong>1+1=2</strong>” islands we’ll find things/tools for rapidly neutralizing people/obstacles with minimal resources; new flying/floating/jumping/loitering/underwater, etc., devices for the same ends, in new media (space, Mars, under water, consciousness, soul, etc.). On these islands we’ll encounter tools to influence consciousness (it’s easier to neutralize a person by influencing their consciousness early so they’re controllable/friendly), biology/DNA, possibly wave/laser/bacterial/DNA-ethno modifiers, etc. We don’t yet have names for everything; some we do — combat drones, nuclear weapons, EW, Starlink, etc. But we know the probability of finding such tools is very high throughout this V&amp;M journey.</p>
<p>Similarly we can undertake V&amp;M journeys in other directions: AI, healthcare, finance, education, etc.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Definition 2. Schematic illustration of how learning models work</figcaption>
</figure><br>
<p>Training modern models in general: finding patterns and mapping functions (transformations of patterns/intermediate data) that minimize training error within the chosen math model. For sequential data (text, time series, etc.), we can add “contextual” information (there’s a dictionary, and for each point we find relevant dictionary/pattern items as weights: big weight near a word ⇒ more relevant for that point/pattern) — commonly called transformers/attention, though I prefer “contextual information”; it’s what our brain does: it looks at “context” beyond direct meaning(s). Then we learn mapping from patterns + context to/from original data. Some mapping functions can be omitted — in this construction they’re constants. In short, that’s what we do now.</p>
<p>Note that because Values and Meanings are far fewer than their manifestations, and relatively static (they generally don’t change fast), the number of parameters our mental world model must track becomes simpler; processes are differentiated into important and less so; and they “slow down” proportionally to the rate of change of Values/Meanings.</p>
<h4 id="model-boundary"><strong>Model boundary</strong></h4>
<p>We’re limited by patterns the model learned + transform functions. If a phenomenon is generated by a different “pattern,” we get a projection of it onto the manifold of variants expressible by the model. If our mapping function from “patterns” to the modeled phenomenon manifold is “poorly learned,” we get “hallucination” — an output not belonging to the phenomenon manifold we model/describe. Since context/meaning couplings are infinite (and hence pattern variations), by this modeling route we’ll never create artificial intelligence; there’ll always be an “uncovered 1%.” It’s akin to representing a signal via a “decaying” basis like <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D1%8F%D0%B4_%D0%A4%D1%83%D1%80%D1%8C%D0%B5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fourier</a>: how many basis elements are needed to represent <strong><em>any</em></strong> function? All of them!</p>
<p>Developing artificial intelligence requires a fundamentally different modeling approach… ultimately of our brain. And do we need artificial intelligence, by the way? For me the answer isn’t obvious.</p>
<p>If you’re interested, for example Alexey Redozubov (<a href="https://boosty.to/aldrd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@AlexeyR</a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/AlexeyR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@habr</a>) has explored alternative paths to AI.</p>
<h4 id="collective-consciousness"><strong>Collective consciousness</strong></h4>
<p>Reality is “broader” than any language; moreover, language largely conditions our reality. Collective consciousness is the maximum of models based on our brain. Strong AI with increased compute may give us a new experience of living reality.</p>
<h3 id="what-vm-motion-will-the-ship-take-how-will-visiting-112-islands-named-kandinsky-70-and-chatgpt-420-affect-society"><strong>What V&amp;M motion will the ship take: how will visiting “1+1=2” islands named Kandinsky 7.0 and ChatGPT 42.0 affect society?</strong></h3>
<p>Sailing this course will “bite off” ever greater parts of the templated nature of our collective consciousness, gradually materializing per the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BF_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%8F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">principle of least resistance</a> (it’s mentally easier to replace than physically). Models will capture more patterns more strongly. In line with <a href="#law2">2. The “Matrix/Oblomov-lite” Law</a> people usually think fairly by-template, so most likely <a href="#law17">17. The “80/20” Law</a> will hold, repeated over the remaining “areas” — the earlier mentioned “uncovered 1%.”</p>
<p>As our ship moves on AI winds, we’ll accelerate: templated tasks will be done faster, new patterns discovered. Often the brake won’t be tech but not knowing what to do with “freed people”; until someone figures that out.</p>
<p>Note that unlike prior tech revolutions, this one differs <em>radically</em> in that we’re replacing, with models (and then, following V&amp;M logic, with robots), our <em>collective consciousness</em> itself, and only afterward, as a consequence, other social phenomena (workplace interactions, text writing, etc.) — i.e., we automate the bedrock. Accordingly, any activity that can be templated/algorithmized we will automate. It follows we won’t be able to invent jobs for people if they aren’t creative (non-templated) and not “roughly” physical (until we learn to make bio-robots/robots).</p>
<p>Whether the discovered phenomena on the islands are named ChatGPT 42.0 or Kandinsky 7.0 isn’t crucial. What’s clear is they’re “<strong>1+1=2</strong>” islands and that such “ordinal versions” will have the properties above.</p>
<p>A notable case is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Shmidel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a business consultant</a> who coded business processes and decision-making in a large company, and it turned out 90% of top management wasn’t needed and was fired (90% of situations are standard and can be solved without the top).</p>
<p>Along the journey we’ll very likely visit a “<strong>1+1&gt;2</strong>” island — a fundamentally different way to model…the brain.</p>
<p>Everyday examples of patterns becoming clearer and speeding us up: templating the work of Data Scientists/Engineers; templates in Miro, Notion, Evernote; presentations; business: <a href="https://wackwork.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/St-Gallen-Business-Model-Innovation-Paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 business-model patterns</a>, etc. By and large, all books on being successful, making friends, presenting, etc., are about learning patterns in different spheres (mostly they reduce to the same inner patterns and experiences — a separate topic).</p>
<p>We usually self-identify, i.e., “stick” to our mental model; hence ads, propaganda, TV, sabotage ops, etc., are so effective — they rely mainly on <em>meta-mental models</em>. Pushing a person from calm into emotion (e.g., triggering fear, trauma, complexes, humiliation, aversion, pride, etc.) reduces awareness and thus activates their mental model, limiting critical thinking.</p>
<h3 id="critique-and-boundaries-of-this-mental-model"><strong>Critique and boundaries of this mental model</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>it’s a very simple model that ignores many aspects: consciousness, collective conscious/unconscious, spiritual, etc.</li>
<li>the model fully relies on a “positivist scientific view,” so the more we know, the more accurate the model; ideally we’d know “closed” information — then many crises and wars would belong to “<strong>1+1=2</strong>” rather than “<strong>1+1&gt;2</strong>,” and we’d foresee islands well in advance.</li>
<li>it’s desirable to use different mental models depending on task and context; professions that foster complex models: psychologist/psychiatrist, sociologist, intel/<a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sabotage operations</a>, marketer/brand specialist, confidence scammers/<a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFVJVizH5Sg&amp;list=PLPhBG-hS1n2Hr7GehFPKrsbO3Jn2yMoK6&amp;ab_channel=FelixShmidel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">philosophers</a>/<a href="http://meditation.college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spiritual practices</a>, investors (D. Soros, C. Munger, W. Buffett), political strategists (V. Surkov, A. Arestovich, Z. Brzezinski, etc.), and others (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@moriartymega" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Professor Moriarty”</a>). In parentheses I listed people who, in my observation, likely use more advanced mental models — call them <em>meta-mental models</em>. There are many <em>meta-mental models</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFVJVizH5Sg&amp;list=PLPhBG-hS1n2Hr7GehFPKrsbO3Jn2yMoK6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an example</a> presented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Shmidel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix Shmidel</a>). Within such models one also operates other mental models when representing reality. Ideally, if you can influence society’s “reality” through collective consciousness, remaining in the shadows is most advantageous; I think many people with incredibly complex meta-mental models are unknown and known only to a very narrow circle. Note that now, to these people’s complex models + closed info + advanced modern brain knowledge and ways to influence collective consciousness, we add AI capabilities (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palantir</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Co</a>, etc.).</li>
<li>note the hardest type: <em>spiritual meta-mental models</em>. Beyond them is the spiritual itself. From observation, such personalities include A. Arestovich, likely V. Surkov, V. Putin; G. Rasputin, G. Gurdjieff, Osho, J. Stalin, J. d’Arc (historical), etc. One difficulty in grasping their worldview is that their core meanings/values lie beyond the material, and in their usual <em>uniqueness</em>. Thus when most attach great importance to houses, yachts, money in their possession, for them it likely has very different meaning — they invest other symbols into them. And we mostly evaluate by ourselves, through our worldview — hence the difficulty.</li>
<li>non-determinism: any mental model is a <em>probabilistic</em> model (even if the probability is almost 100%).</li>

<h3 id="why-its-important-now-to-rethink-why-and-how-we-interact"><strong>Why it’s important now to rethink why and how we interact</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
The drive for high margin leads to even a trip to a mistress turning into a military operation.
<p><em>F. Shmidel</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the realm of “doing,” especially templated doing, hardware will do things better than us; see Law 19. Templates can be non-trivial and very complex — and sooner or later new models will learn them (many templates will surprise most). Within our current mode of interaction we’ve come to where we can teach machines complex templates and mapping functions, with <strong>contextual</strong> information.</p>
<p>We should decide whether we continue our V&amp;M motion under the same winds or…?</p>
<p>Will we see in “others” who are weaker/dumber/less far-sighted, who haven’t learned, or whose time hasn’t come to operate meta-mental models — only a source of goods/goal attainment, a “battery” for resources, a “bio-robot”? Or will we see the value of the other as a living being?</p>
<p>Simply because in this vast galaxy a miracle happened — and before us is a living being who appeared here for some reason, just like you, dear reader!</p>
<p>Note I’ve ignored (geo-)political conflicts, assuming we can negotiate.</p>
<h5 id="in-short"><strong>In short:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>our socio-economic system is unbalanced and inevitably leads to stratification (within countries and globally), ultimately leading to segregation (likely classes: “elite,” “service” (physical, “spiritual,” intellectual), “security,” “bio-mass”);</li>
<li>though it’s already cracking and it’s unclear what shape it takes in 2–10 years;</li>
<li>AI and automation significantly accelerate the dynamics of wealth distribution;</li>
<li>AI and automation are a revolution in the means of production, inevitably leading to social tension and conflict between classes;</li>
<li>Elites are, in most cases, people like us first; we all worry about savings and living standards, children’s future, and act from our mental models and experience. Earning more than they have now makes no sense numerically for I. Musk, B. Gates, W. Buffett, R. Abramovich, J. Bezos, etc. Whether W. Buffett’s fortune is $10B more or less barely affects his real standard of living — not to mention you take nothing with you. Earning beyond a reasonable measure resembles:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
I fight… simply because I fight!
<p><em>Porthos</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The solution seems to me a movement toward a society where everyone can keep doing what they love (e.g., W. Buffett — investing) and maintain a “normal” standard of living, while the means of production — as a result of economic activity — gradually distribute more evenly by consensual agreement. This yields a <strong>gradual</strong> improvement in distribution.</p>
<p>As for being able to agree:</p>
<blockquote>
We can’t agree on anything; any tool or resource becomes a weapon.
<p><em>A. Kubyshkin</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any technology, philosophy, concept becomes a weapon for us: democracy, rumors, car/ship insurance, financial protocols, money, life resources, talents, the internet, history, good intentions — and in any medium: earth, air, water, under water, space, consciousness, soul&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="whats-next"><strong>What’s next</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The main question</strong>: <strong>why and how do we interact with each other?</strong> in relationships, companies, cities, countries, Earth… <em>how else can we interact?</em> The answer, I think, lies in deciding what’s primary/secondary:</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Mutual aid (compassion and mercy)</li>
<li>Competition</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Mutual aid (compassion and mercy)</li>
</ol>
<p>If <strong>(b)</strong>, then follow nature and beasts. E.g., a lion pride capturing new territory after defeating old leaders first kills the little cubs — the offspring of former leaders —</p>
<p><em>it’s easier to eliminate competitors while they’re weak — ideally in the embryo or before birth.</em></p>
<p>Accordingly, it’s most profitable to compete by removing competitors’ children — kill them, make unfavorable conditions for development, fill them with harmful products, etc. Rather than blocking Ukrainian products’ roads, better neutralize all Ukrainian/African children. And treat other people’s children likewise, teach them skills that impede adaptation and development. Better to develop DNA weapons to render women of a certain ethnicity/group infertile; then you won’t need to fight grown warriors. May benefit be with us, for isn’t that what matters most?</p>
<p>If <strong>(a)</strong>, the vector is improving quality of life (many dimensions) for all participants — increasing good. The correctness criterion — that “<em>it didn’t get worse than</em> <strong><em>it was</em></strong>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if I’m told to hold my tongue,</p>
<p>I’ll still keep saying what I know:</p>
<p>What lies ahead — God knows,</p>
<p>But what is mine is mine!</p>
<p><em>I. A. Krylov</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may sound less pretty/ambitious, but in this formula there’s also comparison with what was — take the best of the past, learn from errors and experience, and look ahead cautiously, moving gradually.</p>
<p>Making things “fair”/“equal,” etc., is utopia.</p>
<p>It’s also utopia if someone says <em>I know</em> what’s best for all — the ship’s control system has become too complex. We should aim at this <em>vector</em> and <em>continuous feedback</em> from passengers.</p>
<p>Note that with such movement, passengers are inevitably forced to turn inward to understand what they need and whether it hasn’t gotten worse, which inevitably leads to rethinking consumer culture and other values. With this vector we don’t need strong AI — an argument some make (e.g., for resource allocation); though there’s no conceptual contradiction either.</p>
<p>In future articles I’ll discuss our options and why thinking in terms of capitalism and/or socialism and/or … another …-ism is flawed at the root.</p>
<p>May benefit be with you, for isn’t that what matters most?</p>
<blockquote>
I’m afraid of becoming like adults who care about nothing but numbers...
<p><em>The Little Prince, A. de Saint-Exupéry</em></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- ### **Author’s request**

Feedback matters. Metaphorically speaking, after decades of interacting with the world “from a bunker,” I have mismatches between how I see myself/my thoughts and how others do. It’s made harder by my non-standard thinking and noticing things outside most people’s “radar.” So engaged readers’ feedback is critical: where did you lose me? which example/allegory is unclear/clear? which causal link seems non-obvious/“stretched”? which things are banal and needn’t be written, and which require more detail? etc. Of course I critically check my arguments and logical sequence. Thus, everything I write implies I’ve built causal logic in my head. Surely I miss things; pointing them out matters to me.

<li>new technologies — lots of energy</li>
<li>new tech: closed energy production loop // untested</li>
<li>don’t believe in “green transition” (example of a giant space station with ideal batteries/conditions), little space + scarce battery resources → look at the “BN” (bottleneck) = China</li>
<li>crypto/blockchain + AI</li>
<li>we won’t live in a globalized world!!!</li>

<li>no incentives to take risks in management</li>
<li>personal data via blockchain</li>
<li>ban decentralization tech</li>
<li>drift toward “China’s” model</li>
<li>shift in (capitalist) paradigm</li>
<li>growth impossible if resources are limited</li>
<li>no expansion possible — space; Musk tries; after Chernobyl nuclear tech was frozen for 25 years → conflicts will happen</li>
<li>40% of NASDAQ are “lalaland” companies — unclear what/how/whom they sell and whether they’ll deliver</li>
<li>if you total costs (environment, mining, etc.) — the cleanest energy is nuclear</li>
<li>rising risks, instability, need quick reaction + feedback</li>
<li>the only loser — Europe:</li>
<li>no energy</li>
<li>governance is ineffective (politicians as clowns — incapable)</li>
<li>transition to a new economy is impossible without war: question is how big?</li>
<li>US/China — two models of organizing societies</li>
<li>China’s model amid turbulence may be adopted by others</li>
<li>Japan — prediction (demographics): robots will be “part” of society</li>
<li>conflict in turbulence not necessarily between two states but many</li>
<li>Crimean wars of the 1900s let Britain retain dominance another 100 years</li>
<li>Schwab’s idea of inclusive capitalism: elites are “good,” others are slaves</li>

<li>the financial bubble must pop (40 years) after which building can start</li>
<li>money</li>
<li>tax — a mechanism for the state to incentivize behavior</li>
<li>created not by the state but by banks; less than 1% is “money,” 95% “money” — private banking sector (I think this is understated) no one can define what money is (joke: in the US they can’t define what a woman is) banks have methods of printing/creating money and thus creating financial statements across the system: central bank, banks, non-bank financial institutions: 450–470T USD; global economy: 90T (financial assets in GDP ×6) classic banks: 200T; shadow “banks” (hedge funds, insurance&hellip;): 250T; central banks: 40T; we don’t know how the system works, what counts as money&hellip;</li>

<li>OpenAI — huge advances in AI</li>
<li><strong>but note AI risks (Lex)</strong> — we’re on the cusp of change (in our lifetime)</li>
<li><strong>inspiring</strong>: many known apps, many unknown; will help end poverty and bring us closer to happiness we all seek !!! <em>on what is this based?</em> !!! danger we may be destroyed — Orwell/Huxley 1984… stop thinking, etc.</li>
<li>need a balance between AGI’s possibilities and danger</li>
<li>2015 → declared goal of working on strong AI, many in the field mocked; says they had poor branding</li>
<li>Lex: DeepMind &amp; OpenAI were small groups unafraid to declare the goal to create AGI</li>
<li>Sam: now no one laughs (before they mocked/criticized the AGI goal)</li>
<li>this is about <strong>power</strong>, the psychology of AI creators, etc.</li>
<li><strong>GPT-4 — why and what</strong></li>
<li>Sam: a system we’ll look back on as the first AI — slow, buggy — but it will be important, like computers</li>
<li>Sam: progress is exponential; no “point” to mark</li>
<li>Lex: too much! the problem is filtering data</li>
<li>Sam: many pieces to assemble into a pipeline (new ideas or good implementation)</li>
<li>Lex: quotes “&hellip;chatgpt learns <strong>something</strong>&hellip;.”</li>
<li>Sam: <strong>most important: “how useful is it for people?”</strong></li>
<li>Lex: <strong>not sure we’ll ever understand these models</strong>; they compress the internet/texts into parameters</li>
<li>Sam: by some definitions of intelligence/reasoning — chatgpt can do it at some level — somehow incredible</li>
<li>Lex: many will agree, especially after chatting with it</li>
<li>Sam: agree re ideas</li>
<li>Lex: Peterson asked if Jordan Peterson is a fascist:</li>
<li>Sam: “what people ask says a lot about them” Peterson asked about token length Concluded chatgpt lies and knows it lies.. can’t count length</li>
<li>Sam: I hope these <strong>models bring nuance back</strong> !!! <em>what’s that hope based on?</em> !!!</li>
<li>Sam: progress has exponential nature.. impossible to point to a “leap”</li>
<li>Sam: we RLHF models; otherwise less useful</li>
<li>Sam: some trivial for us — not for model (counting characters, etc.)</li>
<li>Sam: we release early because we believe if THIS will shape the future, the collective feedback finds good/bad behaviors</li>
<li><strong>we could never find things inside companies without collective intelligence</strong> iterative improvements</li>
<li>GPT-4 much better, less biased than 3.5 .. wasn’t especially <strong>proud</strong> of 3.5 biases <em>!!! what role do Ego vs “making the world better” play?</em> !!!</li>
<li>Sam: there will never be 2 people agreeing on quality; over time give <strong>personalized control</strong></li>
<li>Sam: I dreamed of building AI and didn’t think I’d get a chance</li>
<li><strong>I couldn’t imagine</strong> that after the first “primitive” iteration <strong>I’d have to spend time</strong> addressing nitpicks like “how many characters in answers about two people” “<strong>You give people AGI and THIS is what they do?!</strong>” !!! <em>you make something powerful &amp; accessible and don’t know what people will do with it.. maybe decide what/how first?</em> !!! he admits these nitpicks are important !!! <em>contradiction?</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: how much on safety?</li>
<li>Sam: we spend a lot on alignment (safety, bias, “all the good against all the bad”).. proud of GPT-4; lots of testing (!!! <em>no numbers</em> !!!)</li>
<li>Lex: share alignment experience</li>
<li>Sam: <strong>we haven’t found a way to align super-powerful systems</strong></li>
<li>people don’t grasp nuance; alignment work resembles all other work we do (DALL-E)</li>
<li>Sam: we’ll need to <strong>agree</strong> on model boundaries (good/bad..)</li>
<li>users get control via prompts (“answer like xxx..”) prompt engineering as UX</li>
<li>Lex: <strong>since it’s trained on “our” data, we can learn about ourselves</strong></li>
<li>with experience the system responds smarter; feels like a person</li>
<li>Lex: <strong>LLMs/ChatGPT will change the nature of programming</strong></li>
<li>Sam: <strong>already happening; the biggest short-term change</strong> (helps do work/creative better and better) !!! <em>better or just faster? long-term creativity? skill atrophies?</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex/Sam: ask for code, then iteratively improve via “dialogue”.. new debugging?</li>
<li>Sam: <strong>a creative dialogue partner.. that’s huge</strong>! !!! <em>why always faster/more efficient? what about our kids’ skills?</em> !!!</li>
<li>Debating what is “hate speech,” etc., what models should do with it</li>
<li>example of a Constitution as social contract.. democratically !!! <em>is democracy the right tool here?</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: how bad is the base model — <strong>Sam dodged</strong> !!! <em>openness includes unpleasant things</em> !!!</li>
<li>Sam: we’re open to criticism.. not sure we grasp how it affects us.. not sure</li>
<li>Sam: I don’t like when a computer “teaches” me.. important I “control” the process and can “throw the computer out” !!! <em>pressing the human control fear button?</em> !!!</li>
<li><strong>I often say in the office: treat people as adults</strong> !!! <em>what does “adult” mean?</em> !!!</li>

<li>Lex: Noam Chomsky — a major critic that LLMs can reach AGI</li>
<li>do you think LLMs are the path to AGI (consciousness)? Sam: part of the “equation,” but other crucial things needed; extending the ChatGPT paradigm with ideas we don’t yet know; if the “Oracle” told me ChatGPT-10 is AGI, I wouldn’t be shocked; maybe we never build AGI, but make people “super great” !!! <em>at what?</em> !!! and that’s huge !!! <em>maybe recall what it means to be Human first?</em> !!!</li>
<li>Sam: a system that can’t add radically new scientific knowledge isn’t “superintelligence” !!! <em>I read: “I don’t know what strong intelligence is, but I want to build it and believe it makes life better… and I’m also building a bunker&hellip;”</em> !!!</li>

<li>Lex: <strong>AI will be better blah blah, but we’ll need emotions/imperfectness&hellip;</strong></li>
<li>Sam: the uplift to living standards is incredible; we’ll do incredible things !!! <em>based on what? are Japan/Korea/Switzerland/Scandinavia (higher suicide, aging) happier than Jamaica/Bali?</em> !!! people like being useful, drama.. we’ll find a way to provide it !!! <em>so AI makes them useless?! maybe let people decide&hellip;</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: Eliezer Yudkowsky <strong>warns that AGI may destroy humanity</strong></li>
<li>core: <strong>you can’t control superintelligence</strong> Sam: <strong>he may be right</strong> we must focus on the problem approach: <strong>iterative improvement</strong>/<strong>early feedback</strong>/<strong>one-shot limits</strong> Eliezer explained why AI alignment is hard; Sam sees logical errors (unnamed), but overall he thought it through</li>
<li>Lex: will AGI appear fast or gradually? daily life change?</li>
<li>Sam: (Lex agrees) better for the world if <strong>slow, gradual</strong></li>
<li>I fear rapid AGI development</li>
<li>Sam: is GPT-4 AGI?</li>
<li>Lex: like UFO videos, we’d know instantly. Some capabilities not accessible</li>
<li>Sam: GPT-4 isn’t AGI !!! <em>dodged on hidden capabilities</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: does GPT-4 have consciousness?</li>
<li>Sam: I think not; do you?</li>
<li>Lex: it can pretend</li>
<li>Lex: I believe AI will have consciousness; how? suffering, memory, communication</li>
<li>Sam: quoting Ilya Sutskever: if “consciousness” isn’t in training data but the model can answer that “it understands what consciousness feels like,” then… (it has consciousness)</li>
<li>Lex: consciousness is experiencing life (Sam: not necessarily emotions); in the film, a robot smiles to itself (experience for experience’s sake) — a sign of consciousness.. claims emotions may play a leading role</li>
<li>They can’t say anything definitive about consciousness</li>
<li>Lex: reasons things might go wrong en route to AGI? you’ve said you’re inspired and a bit afraid..</li>
<li>Sam: yes, strange to feel no fear</li>
<li>I sympathize with those very afraid !!! <em>“we’re on the same side” — communication technique?</em> !!! <strong><em>didn’t answer</em></strong> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: will you recognize the moment the system becomes super-smart?</li>
<li>Sam: my current worries:</li>
<li>lying/disinformation problems, economic shocks/crises <strong>other things far beyond what we’re ready for</strong> the above doesn’t require AGI; few pay attention… even before AGI !!! <em>he didn’t answer but said there are earlier problems</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: so even scaling current models may change geopolitics?</li>
<li>Sam: how do we know LLMs aren’t steering flows/discourse on Twitter? etc.?</li>
<li>we can’t know! and that’s dangerous… maybe regulation, stronger AI !!! <em>we built a powerful disinformation generator and can’t control consequences — given the huge role of social networks — revolutions have been made through them; so much for “making the world better”</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: how do you handle market pressure (Google, etc.), open-source…? priorities?</li>
<li>Sam: <strong>I stick to my belief and mission</strong> !!! <em>source of mission?</em> !!!</li>
<li>there will be many strong AIs; we’ll offer one; diversity is good at first people laughed but we were brave to declare AGI&hellip; !!! <em>ego vs helping others?</em> !!!</li>
<li>Sam: OpenAI has a complex structure… non-profit control, but pure non-profit didn’t work.. needed some “perks of capitalism”</li>
<li>I think no one wants to destroy the world, so capitalism etc. → “better angels” and good companies win in the end !!! <em>logical error/dangerous assumption</em> !!! we <strong>collectively</strong> discuss and try to mitigate terrible risks</li>
<li>Lex: no one wants to destroy the world !!! <em>unfounded</em></li>
<li>Lex: two guys in a room may say: “Holy crap!!”</li>
<li>Sam: that happens more often than you think</li>
<li>Lex: this can make you the most powerful; worry power corrupts?</li>
<li>Sam: of course! decisions on AI use should be more and more democratized, but we don’t yet know how. One reason: give time to adapt, reflect, adjust laws.</li>
<li>Sam: very bad if one person has access; I do NOT want privileges on the board !!! <em>what happened at your board?</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: creating AGI gives immense power</li>
<li>Sam: (asks questions) do you think we’re doing well? what improve? On Lex’s note on openness, asked if to open GPT-4. Lex said no; he trusts many at OpenAI.</li>
<li>Sam: Google likely wouldn’t open an API; we did; we may not be as open as many want, but we do a lot.</li>
<li>Lex agrees: they fear risks more about access than PR</li>
<li>Sam: people here feel responsibility !!! <em>to whom?</em> !!! open to ideas; gets feedback from talks like this !!! <em>are the most important questions discussable like this?</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: where do you agree with Elon Musk on AGI?</li>
<li>Sam: we align on risks/dangers and that <strong>with AGI life should be better than without</strong> !!! <em>how?</em> !!!!!! <em>Sam often answers with counter-questions on awkward remarks</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: agree/disagree with Elon?</li>
<li>Sam: agree on potential risks</li>
<li>agree that with AGI life should be better for Earth than if AGI never existed Elon attacks us on Twitter; I empathize — he cares about AGI safety !!! <em>again the “empathy” technique</em> !!! I’m sure there are other motives !!! <em>hinting at some game?</em> !!! saw an old SpaceX video where many criticized; Elon said they were his heroes and it hurt; wanted people to see they were trying hard. Elon was Sam’s hero, even if he’s an a** on Twitter !!! <em>strong judgment</em> !!! I’m glad he exists, but I’d like him to notice our hard work to do it right !!! <em>good communication technique</em></li>
<li>Lex: more love! What do you value in Elon in the context of love/acceptance?</li>
<li>Sam: he moved the world forward</li>
<li>electric transport, space; though he’s an a** on Twitter !!! 2nd time !!!, he’s a fun and warm guy</li>
<li>Lex: I like diversity (opinions, people..) and on Twitter there’s a real battle of ideas&hellip;</li>
<li>Sam: maybe I should reply… but not my style… (maybe someday)</li>
<li>Lex: you’re both good people deeply concerned about AGI and with great hope/faith in it !!! <em>maybe be concerned about people, not tech?</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: quoting Elon, chatGPT seems too WOKE (too tolerant, LGBT+, gender, etc.)? bias?</li>
<li>Sam: don’t know what WOKE means anymore !!! <em>doubt</em> !!!, early GPTs were too biased; there’ll never be a version the world agrees is unbiased !!! <em>handy to avoid awkward bias questions</em> !!!</li>
<li>we’ll try to make the base model more neutral</li>
<li>Lex: bias from employees?</li>
<li>Sam: 100% there’s such bias; we try to avoid the “SF cognitive bubble”; I’m going on a world tour to talk with diverse people (did this at YC) !!! <em>he tries to use meta-mental models, understand others</em> !!!</li>
<li>think we avoid the “crazy SF bubble” better than others, but we’re still deep in it !!! <em>admitting imperfection — wins trust</em> !!!</li>
<li>Lex: distinguish model bias from staff bias?</li>
<li>Sam: I worry most about bias from people who fine-tune after! we understand that part the least.</li>
<li><strong>-&gt;</strong><a href="https://youtu.be/L_Guz73e6fw?si=zHbpxWaj9O40cV75&amp;t=5280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This is the central and most</a> important point in the interview and topic overall — solving problems with any tool (AI or else): <strong>we</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/L_Guz73e6fw?si=dJQBd7JEbgrG5S9m&amp;t=5374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t know</a> <strong>how to understand and listen to each other</strong>; without solving this, no AI or AGI will help us agree, we’ll keep fighting — now with AI and its derivatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>=====================================</p>
<p>I’ll stop here because:</p>
<p>a. I don’t see sense to keep listing if the “basis” is clear and lacks focus;</p>
<p>b. it’s energy-consuming and I’m unsure anyone cares and/or finds it useful.</p>
<p><strong>General comments/questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You give people a most powerful tool at the current level of development/consciousness (values, meanings..), so they’ll pursue the same needs/meanings as before — but with a new tool… processes will accelerate: are you sure we’re not on the “Titanic” to speed up the ship?</li>
<li>You can’t calculate consequences within one company; why presume to think/do for others?</li>
<li>What roles do your Ego and ambition play?</li>
<li>Is it true you built/will build a bunker (like Zuckerberg &amp; co)? If yes, why? If we’re not on the “Titanic,” why a bunker? If we are, why speed up?</li>
<li>Why does the company’s name not match its content: why not open code? how do you train? what data? wasn’t the original goal to make OPEN AI for all humanity? then open source?</li>
<li>These models are trained on humanity’s labor (texts, translations, designs, art, video (already in the new model), games, code..): why does someone get to appropriate the model results? They’d be impossible without collective labor: shouldn’t they be open source?</li>
<li>Universal Basic Income: a big mistake — it ignores human nature → much degradation</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t see sense in analyzing the second interview here and comparing it — unclear if anyone needs it; if yes, I’ll watch/analyze/compare later.</p>
