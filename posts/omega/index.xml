      <description>Part 1 About the soul. A person is usually made up of sub-personalities that inhabit a metaphorical little town. In my town there is a Professor. The townspeople themselves gave him that title—an unimpeachable authority, always calm and impartial. A single gesture from him was enough to stop any conflict. He knew what to do&amp;hellip; in war and in famine. He appeared quietly when needed and disappeared just as quietly when the war and hunger ended&amp;hellip; in June 2019.</description>

      <description>Truth, once expressed in form (written, spoken, etc.), ceases to be truth — including what I write... the usual exceptions are metaphors, parables, fairy tales, proverbs... music. After reading this training article, the reader will:
do some mental gymnastics which may, perhaps, increase awareness and thereby bring more freedom to one’s thinking and, as a result, to one’s life; it’s worth periodically rereading this training article, taking notes, trying to grasp the meanings laid out and the links between them.</description>

      <description>[WIP] | [In Progress] *Using Russia as an example “Vecheism” Every resident of Russia should benefit from the country’s resources (not just the “1%”). The ideas of “democracy and freedom” are powerful, but they can be used as cover. A real alternative can be justice, brotherhood, and family values. What follows builds on these principles.
Goal: Justice, brotherhood and family values
✨🤝 We are a “family” 🏡👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Possible roles and participation structure in shared projects/companies:</description>

      <description>Ω. Taking stock of a life stage. I searched for answers to “why all this?” and “how to find inner joy and peace?”. I tried every external source available—from society, spiritual practices, and science to cultures, religions, books, and films. None fit. I found my own path. It isn’t new, but I hope the way I present it will be clear. If not—ask me (contacts below).
To clarify “my coordinates” and the path to my current state, I’ll briefly lay out my story.</description>
