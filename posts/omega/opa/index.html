<p><a href="#lodka">Earlier, the main question was raised: why and how do we interact with each other?</a> Here, I will &ldquo;paint&rdquo; a possible image of the future with &ldquo;colors.&rdquo; I will use two &ldquo;types&rdquo; of &ldquo;colors.&rdquo; To &ldquo;draw&rdquo; a picture of the future, it is enough to describe the foundation:</p>
<ul>
<li>meanings — <strong>what is good?</strong></li>
<li>values — <strong>what is valuable?</strong></li>
<li>metaphysical &ldquo;mythological history&rdquo; — <strong>why?</strong> and <strong>for what?</strong></li>
<li>&ldquo;vector&rdquo; — <strong>what is &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;?</strong></li>

<p><em>&ldquo;The image of the future&rdquo; should be &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and &ldquo;naturally&rdquo;</em>—<em>&ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;, like a woman, like nature. For each person, there will probably be their own meanings and beauty:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>the &ldquo;professor&rdquo; will &ldquo;see&rdquo; in it deep interesting questions and theories</em></li>
<li><em>the &ldquo;soldier&rdquo; will find a reason to live and &ldquo;fight&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>the &ldquo;policeman&rdquo; will feel the importance of his work and the gratitude of the people</em></li>
<li><em>a mother will want to give her daughter another brother</em></li>
<li><em>the &ldquo;artist&rdquo; will paint and create</em></li>
<li><em>the &ldquo;Marxist&rdquo; will see the possibility of realizing his ideas</em></li>
<li><em>the &ldquo;capitalist&rdquo; will see sustainable long-term profit</em></li>
<li><em>the &ldquo;investor&rdquo; will see potential</em></li>
<li><em>the &ldquo;famous journalist&rdquo; will find motivation to risk her life for this</em></li>
<li><em>someone who grew up without parents or without a father will find motivation to become the best version of themselves and build the family they never had</em></li>

<p>&ldquo;Family&rdquo; is needed to raise a &ldquo;child,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ω — Family&rdquo; is needed to &ldquo;raise&rdquo; the &ldquo;Creative Human.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I were growing up &ldquo;again&rdquo; and there were &ldquo;summer programs&rdquo; to live with my class in other republics (Altai, Chechnya, Kuban, Yakutia, Switzerland, Normandy, Africa&hellip;) funded by the &ldquo;state,&rdquo; I would gladly take advantage of such an opportunity to better understand and learn from other cultures. I would study other languages (Chechen, Bashkir, Ukrainian&hellip;) to better understand &ldquo;ultimately life&hellip; and myself&rdquo; and later find a &ldquo;common language.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="balance-in-games"><strong>&ldquo;Balance&rdquo; in &ldquo;Games&rdquo;</strong></h5>
<blockquote>
"A game is 'balanced' if none of the participants are 'against' starting with 'randomly selected roles'."
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing the chess example: chess is not a balanced game because there is an inherent advantage to starting with one set of pieces, reflected in the known advantage of one side or &ldquo;role.&rdquo; To &ldquo;balance&rdquo; it, an even number of games is played, with alternating rights for the first move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Balance&rdquo; in the &ldquo;game&rdquo; implies that within a &ldquo;finite&rdquo; number of &ldquo;moves,&rdquo; each &ldquo;participant&rdquo; can switch their &ldquo;role&rdquo; to another &ldquo;one they like&rdquo; (there are no &ldquo;objective&rdquo; obstacles derived from the &ldquo;game&rsquo;s limitations&rdquo; preventing &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; from becoming &ldquo;wealthy&rdquo;/&ldquo;mayor&rdquo;/&ldquo;singer&rdquo;/&ldquo;president&rdquo;/&ldquo;professor,&rdquo; etc.).</p>
<p>In the chess example: in a match of &ldquo;2-4-6-8-&hellip;&rdquo; games, &ldquo;Player A&rdquo; can become both the winner and the loser, and this will depend &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; on their &ldquo;individual skills&rdquo;—the format of the game gives no inherent advantages, as both &ldquo;Player A&rdquo; and &ldquo;Player B&rdquo; will have an equal number of games starting as &ldquo;white&rdquo; and &ldquo;black,&rdquo; &ldquo;4/4&rdquo;. Therefore, each is &ldquo;agreeable&rdquo; to a &ldquo;random&rdquo; decision regarding the first move in the first game.</p>

<p>Any &ldquo;&hellip;ism,&rdquo; &ldquo;answer,&rdquo; or &ldquo;concept&rdquo; is a <strong>hypothesis</strong> about reality and/or humans/people. There are &ldquo;infinitely&rdquo; many &ldquo;concepts&rdquo; and their &ldquo;variations&rdquo;: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capitalism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marxism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anarchism</a>, <a href="https://en.dreigliederung.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social threefolding</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dictatorship</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anthroposophy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greek myths</a>, etc. Whether someone likes it or not, almost &ldquo;all&rdquo; &ldquo;concepts&rdquo;-&ldquo;answers&rdquo; in certain contexts, for certain collective tasks, for certain people, may be useful and advantageous.</p>
<p>It’s more accurate to think of &ldquo;&hellip;isms&rdquo; as <strong>HYPOTHESES</strong> for solving &ldquo;<a href="https://boosty.to/psychotechnology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collective cognitive</a> and/or physical tasks.&rdquo; Therefore, the correct question is:</p>
<p><em>How can we create such a toolkit to solve various collective cognitive tasks efficiently: quickly formulating &ldquo;collective hypotheses&rdquo; to solve &ldquo;collective cognitive tasks,&rdquo; implementation, testing, gathering and processing feedback, adjustment and changes in implementation, repeating the cycle?</em></p>
<p>The approach should be scientific.</p>

<p>There are 3 ways to &ldquo;reach agreements&rdquo;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agree &ldquo;without violence&rdquo;</li>
<li>Agree with &ldquo;hybrid violence&rdquo;</li>
<li>Agree with &ldquo;violence&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>The second method has a boundary that tends to either the first or the third in the limit. The third method ends with the &ldquo;final violence&rdquo; — death. If an &ldquo;opponent&rdquo; has the ability to &ldquo;take the other with them,&rdquo; there will be a mutual &ldquo;end.&rdquo; Thus, in systems where a &ldquo;player&rdquo; can &ldquo;take the opponent with them,&rdquo; the first option is the only one that, in the limit, does not lead to a &ldquo;mutual end.&rdquo; In other words, in such a &ldquo;system&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
In the end, you will have to reach an agreement — it's a matter of time... or mutual destruction.
</blockquote>
<p>Note that I am not excluding aggression and war. I define violence as the forcible violation of another&rsquo;s will, but if the participants agree to &ldquo;fight/compete,&rdquo; it is not violence but &ldquo;aggression.&rdquo; The same applies to wars where there is an &ldquo;attack.&rdquo; In this concept, aggression is acceptable, but it is directed toward &ldquo;non-violence&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;defense.&rdquo;</p>
<h5 id="vecheism"><strong>Vecheism</strong></h5>

<p>Unlike other &ldquo;isms,&rdquo; Vecheism does not assume predefined roles within any specific &ldquo;ism&rdquo; but is based on a family model of decision-making regarding collective hypotheses and implementation — beginning with what we strive for, &ldquo;Ω — family.&rdquo; It is founded on three principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Truth</strong> (the pursuit of truth, primarily with oneself)</li>
<li><strong>Justice</strong> (the pursuit of justice, understanding that it may differ for everyone)</li>
<li><strong>Honor</strong> (the pursuit of &ldquo;living by conscience,&rdquo; to live according to one&rsquo;s &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; without betraying it)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
In nature, everything is wisely thought out and arranged; everyone should do their own thing, and in this wisdom lies the highest justice of life.

<p>Agreements reached (&ldquo;shaking hands&rdquo;) at a veche (assembly) must be fulfilled, as in &ldquo;a given word must be kept&rdquo; or &ldquo;standing by your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Family</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>God</strong> (the one &ldquo;parents&rdquo; listen to; a set of &ldquo;principles and rules&rdquo; — &ldquo;do not kill, do not steal&hellip;&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Parent</strong>&rdquo; - veto power (&ldquo;parents do not interfere in children&rsquo;s decisions but teach them to mature by warning against obvious mistakes based on their rich experience&rdquo;) — 25% &ldquo;profit&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;investors&rdquo; or &ldquo;founders of large projects&rdquo;&hellip; those who have much to offer/teach others — the &ldquo;children&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Older children</strong>&rdquo; - 3 votes — 25% &ldquo;profit&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;directors&rdquo; or &ldquo;top management&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Middle children</strong>&rdquo; - 3 votes — 25% &ldquo;profit&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;employees&rdquo; or &ldquo;participants&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Younger children</strong>&rdquo; - 3 votes — 25% &ldquo;profit&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;consumers&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Vecheism is a method for selecting and testing &ldquo;collective hypotheses&rdquo; that can be implemented on blockchain. Importantly, when making decisions, feedback mechanisms are also established, which can be gathered through mobile devices, allowing quicker assessment of whether &ldquo;progress is in the right direction.&rdquo; The system will store experiences and interaction &ldquo;templates&rdquo; and suggest pre-made collaboration &ldquo;templates&rdquo; with the possibility of modification (as seen with Miro, Notion, DAO constructors, etc.). The results of collective work are distributed within the blockchain system (also used for voting, feedback, and more).</p>
<p>In the process of &ldquo;growing,&rdquo; a person can &ldquo;mature&rdquo; or become a &ldquo;parent.&rdquo; Existing companies (e.g., Sberbank, Gazprom) can be reformatted into &ldquo;Vecheism&rdquo; while retaining their current structure, but now everyone &ldquo;benefits from the success of the family business&hellip; including financially.&rdquo; This can start with a small enterprise in one location, leading to conclusions and adaptations, and gradually tested in other contexts, considering the unique characteristics of each case.</p>

<p>Considering our people&rsquo;s distaste for rigid disciplinary systems, Vecheism offers both flexibility and a foundation close to our hearts (justice — truth — honor). This is something we can &ldquo;offer&rdquo; the world as an alternative. Moreover, we are not limited to any specific structure and can take the best from everything already invented, while also creating new &ldquo;isms&rdquo; and testing them efficiently (perhaps starting small, adjusting, and scaling up — something that may have been missing in the USSR for the gradual implementation of changes).</p>
<p>It seems that our people value &ldquo;substance&rdquo; more than &ldquo;form.&rdquo; Perhaps this is why terms like PR, marketing, branding, and the like weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;invented&rdquo; in our culture but were imported. These concepts focus on &ldquo;form,&rdquo; an area where we lag behind other cultures. Perhaps we should &ldquo;accept ourselves as we are&rdquo;: why would we need something, even if it &ldquo;sounds,&rdquo; &ldquo;smells,&rdquo; or &ldquo;feels&rdquo; good, if it lacks justice, truth, and honor? Maybe, to solve &ldquo;collective cognitive tasks,&rdquo; we should start with the foundation: justice — truth — honor, and select the &ldquo;form&rdquo; based on the situation, relying on &ldquo;feedback and experience&rdquo; from others.</p>
<p>The basis of Vecheism is an &ldquo;organizational constructor&rdquo; (based on blockchain) with fast feedback. Smart contracts reduce &ldquo;bureaucracy,&rdquo; outlining all &ldquo;roles,&rdquo; &ldquo;legal nuances and templates,&rdquo; allowing the creation of any organization (<a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE_%D1%81_%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%8E_%28%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DAO</a>, etc.) with just a few clicks and concluding contracts (using electronic signatures). <a href="https://copenomics.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initial groundwork is already underway</a>.

<p>If the owners do not want to reformat their enterprises into a &ldquo;family version or something similar&rdquo; — that&rsquo;s fine. Some people need to own &ldquo;newspapers, factories, and steamships&rdquo;&hellip; it happens&hellip; the main thing is that it passes&hellip;, we can wait 11-111 years until they are gone — no one has taken anything with them yet. After that, various options can gradually be tested, if there is a demand.</p>

<blockquote>
To live means not only to satisfy the material demands of the body but primarily to be aware of one’s human unity.
<p><em>J. Verne</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without increasing justice, the accumulated internal contradictions are &ldquo;suppressed&rdquo; by redirecting attention and &ldquo;righteous anger&rdquo; towards a &ldquo;common enemy,&rdquo; whether internal, external, or hybrid. This is achieved by shaping an anthropotype of a person — a &ldquo;dopamine addict&rdquo; with a low level of critical thinking, ideally with a (cognitive) &ldquo;trauma.&rdquo; This is practiced to varying degrees by all states, with some achieving greater success (Ukraine, USA, Russia), and others less so (Switzerland).</p>
<p>It’s also &ldquo;common&rdquo; to &ldquo;export&rdquo; internal contradictions, tension, and problems abroad (for example, through financial-insurance systems, legislation) while &ldquo;importing&rdquo; resources (such as human capital, minerals).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masculinity&rdquo; and &ldquo;male aggression&rdquo; are a &ldquo;threat&rdquo; to the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; — the system, which is why the fostered anthropotype will be a &ldquo;castrated man&rdquo;/&ldquo;feminized,&rdquo; which will be &ldquo;encouraged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seem to be more worthy targets for righteous anger than &ldquo;Jew against Palestinian,&rdquo; &ldquo;Azerbaijani against Armenian,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ukrainian against Russian,&rdquo; and vice versa. For instance, slavery (we’ve broken the &ldquo;historical record&rdquo; for the number of slaves in the world), child and human trafficking, organ trafficking from children, pedophilia among the &ldquo;elite,&rdquo; &ldquo;satanism&rdquo; and/or misanthropy, and world hunger. When I was little, it was &ldquo;Africa is starving,&rdquo; at age 10 - &ldquo;Africa is starving,&rdquo; at 20 - &ldquo;Africa is starving,&rdquo; at 30 - &ldquo;Africa is starving&rdquo;; and now I’m 40, &ldquo;Africa is still starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know of few problems that cannot be solved in 40 years (!!!). If this problem hasn’t been solved (hunger in Africa), then it is <strong>beneficial</strong> to the beneficiaries of the existing world order (e.g., grain brokers from England &hellip;; traders on exchanges in England, Switzerland &hellip;; consumers of cheap resources from Africa, both minerals and human&hellip;).</p>

<h5 id="forgiveness-and-compassion"><strong>Forgiveness and Compassion</strong></h5>
<p>Ivanov stole — imprison him, Petrov also — &ldquo;execute,&rdquo; Rabinovich embezzled — &ldquo;bloodsuckers&rdquo;&hellip; It seems to me that if you took &ldquo;10 people from the street,&rdquo; perhaps they would &ldquo;steal&rdquo; just as much. The issue, then, lies in our mindset and values.</p>
<p>Someone loves &ldquo;newspapers, factories, and steamships&rdquo; (personally, I don&rsquo;t need this, I give up &ldquo;my share&rdquo; to them)&hellip; it happens, as long as it passes.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, people who have reached high positions, possessing &ldquo;newspapers, factories, and steamships,&rdquo; are extraordinary and talented in their own way. Perhaps we should gradually &ldquo;reset the social contract,&rdquo; release such a person if they have &ldquo;repented and want to do something for the benefit of people,&rdquo; and try to find an application for their talents (maybe they&rsquo;re a talented schemer, and such skills are needed in foreign affairs or elsewhere). This way, they can continue to own &ldquo;newspapers, factories, and steamships,&rdquo; while society also benefits. It seems that if society openly offered this person 200 million instead of stealing 1 billion, and they applied their &ldquo;true&rdquo; talents where needed, everyone would benefit.</p>

Everyone exclaims: where is the person who will save us? We need a person! Do not seek this person. They are right in front of you. This person is you, me, each of us! How to make yourself a true human? Nothing is more difficult if you don't know how to want it; nothing is easier — if you want it.

Our children are also our "parents" in certain contexts, perhaps even our greatest "teachers": there is much we can learn from them — for example, preschoolers from "Ukraine," "Russia," "Israel," "Palestine," "Turkey," "America," "Greece," "Armenia," "Azerbaijan"... would likely easily find "common ground" while playing, and after their schooling... Likewise, a boy from Africa, scoring his first goal, would not be any less joyful than an Oligarch buying a new yacht...

<p>Andrey (from Greek, &ldquo;man&rdquo;) sought meaning. Taking the ball of yarn from Baba Yaga, he risked his life and descended to the bottom of the sea to find the treasures he was searching for. The treasures were intact, although Andrey gained scars and prosthetics in the process of descending. He celebrated his discovery in the forest with the birds, trees, wind, and Earth&hellip; The treasures were so beautiful that there were no words to describe them. He decided to share them in the best way he could. The treasures remained there, untouched—Andrey no longer needed them, as they are now always with him and no less valuable. The birds and others joined in celebrating the joy of his discovery.</p>
