      <description>Part 1 About the soul. A person is usually made up of sub-personalities that inhabit a metaphorical little town. In my town there is a Professor. The townspeople themselves gave him that title‚Äîan unimpeachable authority, always calm and impartial. A single gesture from him was enough to stop any conflict. He knew what to do&amp;hellip; in war and in famine. He appeared quietly when needed and disappeared just as quietly when the war and hunger ended&amp;hellip; in June 2019.</description>
